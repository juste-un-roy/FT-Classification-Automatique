Frequently, however, the surface properties of the polymer fibers that compose the mat need to be modified and tuned. This review covers the main surface modification techniques used to change the water wettability of mats produced by electrospinning. Some basic aspects of the electrospinning process and wetting theories are presented as a starting point for the discussion, highlighting the common wetting switching mechanism found in highly porous structures like electrospun mats. The surface modification techniques are then classified as post-treatments or one-step modification during electrospinning.

We conducted a systematic mapping study and it revealed that the extent to which the authors/researchers are focused on EA, the sectors in which they are working, the academic disciplines in which they have studied, the countries where their affiliated organizations are located, the subject areas of the journals/publishers of their publications and the way they have approached EA and its practitioners are some major elements that might influence the existing uniformity in EA. In addition, this study demonstrates how important it is to pay attention to the definition of 'enterprise architecture' itself. The contribution of this study is the organization of the EA literature according to three major questions concerning 'who' have been published in the literature, 'where' they have been located and 'what' their publications are about. This helps to better identify sources of variety which could be on the basis of the lack of common understanding in EA and provides practitioners and stakeholders a better understanding of this challenge.

Over the past two decades, several research works, methods and software have been developed to combine the 3D digital model of BIM (building information modeling) to the construction activities in order to simulate a 4D simulation of the project construction process. The fourth dimension is time. The simulation shows the work sequences with the aim of correcting planning errors, execution conflicts and serving as an aid in optimizing the worksite. The time dimension was added by integrating the Gantt/Precedence diagram into the simulation. Despite its almost exclusive popularity, this method hardly represents the spatial management of the site, the occupancy rate and the circulation of people and materials. For that, the 4D modeling process was quite demanding in terms of time and effort with several rounds back and forth between the BIM model and the schedule. The Chronographic modeling, a space planning method has the ability to alternate between visual representations approaches using a set of graphical parameters. Each approach can help to model adapted schedules for different project types and specialties, shows valuable information in a clear and comprehensible manner and facilitate solving construction site problems visually. The aim of this paper is to present a communication strategy between the 3D-BIM model, the Chronographical modeling and the 4D simulation. The development process consists of four steps. The first step is to define the numerical parameters to adapt the model to the space management. The second step serves to develop a communication strategy and tool. The third step presents the Chronological scheduling process and the last step was the validation of the results through the simulation. The obtained result demonstrates the validity of the proposed solution by integrating the spatial management to the 4D simulation. Future work could integrate supply management and or apply the solution to case studies in order to validate and improve the process.;\"[Mazars, Thibault; Francis, Adel] Quebec Univ, ETS, Construct Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;Francis, A (corresponding author), Quebec Univ, ETS, Construct Engn Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;adel.francis@etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2020;112;;;;;;;;103076;10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103076;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103076;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000526785600013;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

This paradigm shift has also necessitated the introduction of innovative tools capable of capturing the complex and dynamic nature of modern sociotechnical systems. In our research, we argued at previous stages for adopting a more systemic and human-centric perspective to evaluate the context of aircraft de-icing operations. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was applied in the first stage for this purpose. Consequently, fuzzy logic was combined with FRAM in the second stage to provide a quantified representation of performance variability. Fuzzy logic was used as a quantification tool suitable for computing with natural language. Several limitations were found in the data collection and rule generation process for the first prototype. In the third phase, the model was further improved by integrating rough sets as a data-mining tool to generate and reduce the size of the rule base and classify outcomes. In this paper, we reflect on the three stages of the project and discuss in a qualitative manner the challenges and limitations faced in the development and application of the models. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the three models as experienced in our case are presented at the end.

High-quality mechanical parts include those with better surface finish and texture, dimension and form accuracies, reduced residual stress and burr-free. Burr formation is one of the most common and undesirable phenomenon occurring in machining operations, which reduces assembly and machined part quality. To remove burrs, a secondary operation known as deburring is required for post-processing and edge finishing operations. Since deburring is costly and considered a non-value-added process, the goal is desired to eliminate burrs or reduce the effort required to remove them. Because of non-uniform chip thickness, tool runout and complex interactive effects between cutting process parameters, milling burr formation is a very complex mechanism. Therefore, research and close attention are still needed in order to minimize and control milling burr formation. In this article, a review of burr formation and characterization is presented, along with burr formation modeling and control. An overview of factors governing milling burr formation is also presented.;\"[Niknam, Seyed Ali; Songmene, Victor] ETS, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Songmene, V (corresponding author), ETS, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;victor.songmene@etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;21;21;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2015;229;6;;;;;893;909;;10.1177/0954405414534827;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0954405414534827;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000353989900001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

While the building information modeling (BIM) approach plays an important role in such a transition, more and more technological approaches are emerging and grouped together under the concept of Construction 4.0. However, the contours of Construction 4.0 as a scientific domain are far from being clearly defined. A few literature reviews have been published in an attempt to clarify its meaning and define its enabling technologies, but do not provide a complete view of the research efforts. To fully understand the research effort, it is necessary to study the different communities and clusters, their weights and their interrelationships. This paper proposes a mapping of the Construction 4.0 research themes and clusters over 10 years of scientific publications, using a systematic literature review approach. 2444 papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2019 were identified and the associated keywords were analyzed in order to highlight their co-occurrences. The research shows how BIM plays a central role in the digital transformation, hiding a forest of emerging technologies represented by the main clusters identified. Of the 10 main enabling technologies in 2018, only three were already mentioned in 2010. Some of these technologies (Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, 3D printing and Big Data) seem to be in the position to occupy an increasingly important place in the coming years. It seems more difficult for other technologies (e.g., cyber physical systems) to find an important place, due to a lack of awareness in the industry.

Furthermore, scarceness of qualified workforce is expected in the near future. Construction automation is introduced as a solution to these challenges. The capabilities of construction robots are improving at an accelerated pace. They are starting to be used in non-laboratory contexts for automating processes ranging from infrastructure inspection to digital fabrication. One fundamental requirement of employing robots in construction is their autonomous positioning. Building information modelling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) are now a necessity for the construction projects. Integration between BIM and GIS provides holistic digital representation of the built environment that robots could potentially utilize for positioning purposes. Preceding this research, a number of reviews have been conducted on BIM-GIS integration, but none studied it from automation perspective. This research addresses this deficiency through a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art on BIM-GIS integration with the purpose of robot positioning and navigation on construction sites. Using software tools and science-mapping methods, 236 papers were explored. Trends, challenges, potentials, and deficiencies identified and mapped. Citation patterns of journal articles along with the analysis of studies; visualized and analyzed.

However, even the best fitness measure is often not precise enough to reveal the behavior of the optimizer's added features or the nature of the interactions among its parameters. This makes customization of an efficient search method a rather difficult task. The aim of this paper is to propose a diagnostic tool to help determine the impact of parameter setting by monitoring the exploration/exploitation balance (EEB) of the search process, as this constitutes a key characteristic of any population-based optimizer. It is common practice to evaluate the EEB through a diversity measure. For any diagnostic tool developed to perform this function, it will be critical to be able to certify its reliability. To achieve this, the performance of the selected measure needs to be assessed, and the EEB framework must be able to accommodate any landscape structure. We show that to devise a diagnostic tool, the EEB must be viewed from an orthogonal perspective, which means that two diversity measures need to be involved: one for the exploration axis, and one for the exploitation axis. Exploration is best described by a genotypic diversity measure (GDM), while exploitation is better represented by a phenotypic convergence measure (PCM). Our paper includes a complete review of PCM formulations, and compares nearly all the published PCMs over a validation framework involving six test cases that offer controlled fitness distribution. This simple framework makes it possible to portray the underlying behavior of phenotypic formulations based on three established requirements: monotonicity in fitness varieties, twinning, and monotonicity in distance. We prove that these requirements are sufficient to identify phenotypic formulation weaknesses, and, from this conclusion, we propose a new PCM, which, once validated, is shown to comply with all the above-mentioned requirements. We then compare these phenotypic formulations over three specially designed fitness landscapes, and, finally, the new phenotypic formulation is combined with a genotypic formulation to form the foundation of the EEB diagnostic tool. The value of such a tool is substantiated through a comparison of the behaviors of various genetic operators and parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V.

The proposed cost model will use Microsoft Excel spreadsheet developed in house which imputes all industrial and academic data for calculating costs elements such as material, labour, energy, machinery, building costs and costs of working capital, overheads and then the total cost per part. This research study focused, on one hand, at estimating the heating costs for experimental and virtual parts by changing the volume and keeping the same process cycle times. The heating power was determined by simulating the process thermal diagram numerically using finite elements COMSOL software and validated by experimental data. On the other hand, the tooling costs were estimated by DFMA software for experimental and virtual moulds by changing the projected area. Then, the heating energy and tooling costs sizing scaling laws were established under linear equation forms limited to the size of platens areas. These linear equations were inputted in an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the cost of new parts, which have not been made yet. The variation of the total cost with the size and the complexity of the part were investigated. The results showed that the calculated heating energy costs of the three experimental randomly oriented strand parts were different due to different geometries of the heating platens and the moulds. For the mould cost, the more complex the form was the higher the cost. For total cost, it was also demonstrated that the manufacturing cost of L-bracket part was higher than that of flat plate and T-shape part due to higher process cycle time.;\"[El Wazziki, Mohamed; Anh Dung Ngo] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Lab Fabricat & Caracterisat Mat Composites, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;El Wazziki, M (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;elwazzikimohamed@yahoo.fr;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2019;233;6;;;;;1241;1251;;10.1177/1464420717719097;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1464420717719097;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000471158100016;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

We address the problem via small kernels, allowing deeper architectures.

Digital images are increasingly transmitted over non-secure channels such as the Internet. Therefore, military, medical and quality control images must be protected against attempts to manipulate them; such manipulations could tamper the decisions based on these images. To protect the authenticity of multimedia images, several approaches have been proposed. These approaches include conventional cryptography, fragile and semi-fragile watermarking and digital signatures that are based on the image content. The aim of this paper is to present a survey and a comparison of emerging techniques for image authentication. Methods are classified according to the service they provide, that is strict or selective authentication, tamper detection, localization and reconstruction capabilities and robustness against different desired image processing operations. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of image content and discuss the most important requirements for an effective image authentication system design.

Justified by its impact on the bottom line, various measures were adopted for resolution and prevention. However, despite the abundance of literature on the topic, there continues to be a lack of evidence on which of the measures are the most prolific, that is, how the concern of interest is actually handled. Such evidence would highlight missed opportunities and set the stage for future research. Toward this goal, the authors conducted a mapping study analyzing 590 articles. The findings reveal that corporate social responsibility, sustainable reporting, and social life cycle assessment are the most used methods whereas systems thinking ranks far behind. This work is original in that it is the first of its kind to reveal such findings scientifically.

The MAC layer supports a multiuser detection based access protocol. Users send data packets at different rates, depending on the fading channel state. The framework is based on an LMS (Least Mean Square) prediction algorithm that estimates channel gain at the physical layer. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by simulations. Multiuser detection typically triples the throughput of ad hoc networks but our prediction-based scheme further doubles this metric. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is its flexibility and efficiency in a wide range of data rates and target bit error rates.

However, the routine statistical protocols cannot be directly applied because of challenges arising from nondetects or left-censored observations, which are concentration measurements below the detection limit of measuring instruments. Despite the existence of techniques based on survival analysis that can adjust for nondetects, these are seldom taken into account properly. A comprehensive review of the literature showed that managing policies regarding analysis of censored data do not always agree and that guidance from regulatory agencies may be outdated. Therefore, researchers and practitioners commonly resort to the most convenient way of tackling the censored data problem by substituting nondetects with arbitrary constants prior to data analysis, although this is generally regarded as a bias-prone approach. Hoping to improve the interpretation of concentration data, the present article aims to familiarize researchers in different disciplines with the significance of left-censored observations and provides theoretical and computational recommendations (under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks) for adequate analysis of censored data. In particular, the present article synthesizes key findings from previous research with respect to 3 noteworthy aspects of inferential statistics: estimation of descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

The winding is then influenced by both skin and proximity phenomenon, which makes the current distribution uneven resulting in an increased resistance. The study of improving AC resistance of a PCB winding has been tackled by many researchers. However, the lack of an overview and comparison among improvements has made it difficult to apply those methods to a specific winding. To overcome the above limitations, this paper investigates the pros and cons of three popular AC resistance optimizing methods: optimizing track width of a solid PCB winding, using multi-strands and using Litz style PCB winding. To verify the theoretical analysis, a total of 12 PCBs are simulated by finite element (FEM) and tested in the laboratory. Five criteria are analyzed, including skin resistance, proximity resistance, AC to DC ratio, total AC resistance and complexity are taken into consideration. The results of this study show that optimizing track width method has a significant improvement on AC resistance while the use of Litz PCB is effective for applications that need stable AC resistance in a wide frequency range. The use of parallel strands winding should be carefully considered as there is not significant benefit in both reducing the AC resistance and AC to DC ratio.;\"[Nguyen, Minh Huy; Fortin Blanchette, Handy] Ecole Technol Super ETS, Dept Elect Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Blanchette, HF (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super ETS, Dept Elect Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;\"huynm2@hcmut.edu.vn; handy.fortin-blanchette@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2020;9;8;;;;;;;1324;10.3390/electronics9081324;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics9081324;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568029700001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

For such tests, specimen preparation is important, particularly the saturation process. The presence of gas bubbles in the tested specimen leads to smaller hydraulic conductivity values and may affect particle migration. Therefore, measures must be taken to obtain fully saturated specimens. In order to improve saturation, two elements have to be taken into consideration: first, the presence of gas in the permeant water; second, the presence of gas in the pores of the specimen. Several flow tests are described in ASTM standards. These standards involve different conditioning methods for permeant water (e.g., heating, seepage through a sand filter, cavitation under vacuum), and different specimen saturation methods (e.g., saturation with an upward flow under vacuum, following carbon dioxide flushing). In this article, water deaeration and specimen saturation methods were evaluated and compared using a mass-volume method. In the first phase, the importance of using deaerated permeant water was examined by comparing different conditioning methods for permeant water. Saturation using water in equilibrium with atmospheric pressure was compared with saturation with water heated at 40 degrees C, water deaerated using a sand filter, and water deaerated by cavitation under vacuum. In the second phase, the influence of purging the gas contained in the soil specimen before saturation using carbon dioxide or a vacuum was compared. In both cases, the permeant water was deaerated by cavitation under vacuum. These tests showed that combining a purge of the specimen with carbon dioxide with saturation using an upward flow of water deaerated by cavitation under vacuum yielded the highest degree of saturation for granular specimens in a rigid-wall permeameter. Another advantage of this combination is that it accelerates specimen saturation.\";\"[Bouin, Celine; Weber, Simon; Ethier, Yannic A.; Dube, Jean-Sebastien; Duhaime, Francois] Ecole Technol Super, Lab Geotech & Geoenvironm Engn, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Bouin, C (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Lab Geotech & Geoenvironm Engn, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;celine.bouin.1@ens.etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2021;44;4;;;;;1135;1152;;10.1520/GTJ20190181;http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/GTJ20190181;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000664300000017;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Maintenance involves different methods and technologies that extend life by slowing the rate of deterioration. Currently, the structural conditions of the road network are assessed in the traditional way, that is, it is done manually by technicians using specialized tools. Thus, to measure deflection, for example, we use a deflectometer or a Benkelman beam. If you want to assess the deterioration of the road surface or count the vehicles passing on a road, then technicians must make a visual analysis of the road. In the same vein, most of the available research evaluates the results of data extraction and does so mainly visually. So, when a frame of reference is available, an adjustment is made to modify the database. This is where IoT (Internet of Things) comes in place by creating a simple automation process to standardize the data and transform them in information to create a database and measure the quantity and quality of the deformation with a Neural Network. The data set has been categorized manually into different types of deterioration, allowing it to be measured quantitatively and qualitatively. The sample comes from images collected by a GoPro camera, on a 60-degree angle, at 15 FPS. 4 different types of deformation were present in the data set; our model predicted with a precision ranging between 50% and 90% the different types of deformation. The validation of the results of the model shows 71% of true positive. This process automation provides standardized information for a road qualification and quantification system.

In this situation, we wonder what the relevant elicitation techniques are and how we can help experts to express their knowledge.

In this study, multiple experts have been involved in order to predict the defect size in hydraulic turbines, according to four proposed elicitation techniques. The comparison between these techniques was performed based on a suggested algorithm using the area metric concept.

Premature bond failure, the behavior of the interface layer between FRP composites and the concrete substrate, the complex and brittle nature of shear cracks, and the adverse interaction between internal steel stirrups and EB-FRP are some of these phenomena. Compared to experimental investigations, the finite element (FE) technique provides an accurate, cost-effective, and less time-consuming tool, enabling practicing engineers to perform efficient, accurate nonlinear and dynamic analysis as well as parametric studies on RC beams strengthened with EB-FRP. Since 1996, many numerical studies have been carried out on the response of RC beams strengthened using FRP. However, only a few have been related to RC beams strengthened in shear using EB-FRP composites. In addition, the analytical models that have been reported so far have failed to address and encompass all the factors affecting the contribution of EB-FRP to shear resistance because they have mostly been based on experimental studies with limited scopes.

As this remediation technique is approaching extensive on-field experimentation and commercialization, research focus is on investigating new ways to achieve the valorisation of its by-products. Biomass pyrolysis represents a key step to numerous valorisation options and it is characterized by differential output products that are determined by the operating conditions of the process and the characteristics of the input. However, when used to valorise plants that have undergone significant metal uptake, this strategy involves some new aspects related to harvest, procedure and final product reutilization. This paper reviews the studies made on biomass pyrolysis of plants with emphasis on the differential quality and distribution of pyrolysis products in relation with the variables of the process and the metal-rich phytoextraction feedstock properties. By investigating these parameters, this survey provides indications on ways to optimize the valorisation of phytoremediation by-products through biomass pyrolysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This protective role involves a multitude of complementary mechanisms associated with graphene's unique geometry and chemistry. In this review, these mechanisms, taking place during both the initiation and propagation steps of photodegradation, are discussed concerning graphene and graphene derivatives, i.e., graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In particular, graphene displays important UV absorption, free radical scavenging, and quenching capabilities thanks to the abundant pi-bonds and sp(2) carbon sites in its hexagonal lattice structure. The free radical scavenging effect is also partially linked with functional hydroxyl groups on the surface. However, the sp(2) sites remain the predominant player, which makes graphene's antioxidant effect potentially stronger than rGO and GO. Besides, UV screening and oxygen barriers are active protective mechanisms attributed to graphene's high surface area and 2D geometry. Moreover, the way that graphene, as a nucleating agent, can improve the photostability of polymers, have been explored as well. These include the potential effect of graphene on increasing polymer's glass transition temperature and crystallinity.;\"[Karimi, Samira; Madinehei, Milad; David, Eric; Samara, Mazen; Demarquette, Nicole] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St W, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Helal, Emna; Gutierrez, Giovanna; Moghimian, Nima] NanoXplore Inc, 4500 Thimens Blvd, St Laurent, PQ H4R 2P2, Canada\";;\"Demarquette, N (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St W, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;Helal, E (corresponding author), NanoXplore Inc, 4500 Thimens Blvd, St Laurent, PQ H4R 2P2, Canada.\";\"samira.karimi.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; emna.helal@nanoxplore.ca; giovanna.gutierrez@nanoxplore.ca; nima.moghimian@nanoxplore.ca; miladmadinehei@gmail.com; Eric.David@etsmtl.ca; mazen.samara@etsmtl.ca; nicoler.demarquette@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2021;11;1;;;;;;;3;10.3390/cryst11010003;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryst11010003;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000610120900001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Nevertheless, this claim could somehow be unsubstantiated. In this article, the authors try to shed some light on this issue by using the concept of energy return on investment (EROI) as a yardstick. This choice brings semantic issues because in this paper the EROI is used in a different context than that of energy production. Indeed, while watts and negawatts share the same physical unit, they are not the same object, which brings some ambiguities in the interpretation of EROI. These are cleared by a refined definition of EROI and an adapted nomenclature. This review studies the research in the energy efficiency of building operation, which is one of the most investigated topics in energy efficiency. This study focuses on the impact of insulation and high efficiency windows as means to exemplify the concepts that are introduced. These results were normalized for climate, life time of the building, and construction material. In many cases, energy efficiency measures imply a very high EROI.

It can significantly improve the performance of these networks, the channel capacity (in mobile ad hoc networks, especially single-channel ones, capacity is a more appropriate term than bandwidth, capacity is measured in bits/s and bandwidth in Hz) and battery power of which are limited. In the past couple of years, a number of multicast routing protocols have been proposed. In spite of being designed for the same networks, these protocols are based on different design principles and have different functional features when they are applied to the multicast problem. This paper presents a coherent survey of existing multicasting solutions for MANETs. It presents various classifications of the current multicast routing protocols, discusses their operational features, along with their advantages and limitations, and provides a comparison of their characteristics according to several distinct features and performance parameters. Moreover, this paper proposes classifying the existing multicast protocols into three categories according to their layer of operation, namely, the network layer, the application layer, and the MAC layer. It also extends the existing classification system and presents a comparison between them. Copyright (C) 2009 O. S. Badarneh and M.

SSCM can solve different challenges faced by this sector. Academics and practitioners consider the opportunities offered by decision-making tools for planning sustainable petroleum supply chains. Moreover, the ever-increasing number of publications applying decision-making models to the petroleum industry also attests to this fact. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the evolution of sustainable supply chain planning in the petroleum industry and highlight the specificities of the body of knowledge in this area. A comprehensive analysis is performed using 23 papers published from 2010 to 2019. This paper proposes a classification framework to analyze different factors in developing mathematical models, including the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social). The main observation is that planning models that focus on all three sustainability dimensions in the petroleum sector are scarce. Regarding the environmental dimension, the analysis demonstrates that consideration of greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2 impacts, is dominating planning models. Furthermore, there is an absence of quantitative models that include social dimensions, and this gap must be addressed in the future.

Even if they must be considered as a last resource in a traditional occupational Health & Safety approach, personal protective equipment (PPE) against nanoparticles need to be available right away, while the other more upstream risk management strategies are developed, assessed and put into action. However, the current picture of the situation relative to PPE against nanoparticles is rather worrying. For one part, there is an almost complete void worldwide in terms of regulations, standard testing methods and selection guides relative to PPE against nanoparticles. In addition, even if most claim that certified respirators should offer the needed level of protection against nanoparticles, large uncertainties remain, in particular in relation with the thermal rebound effect reported by some researchers for particles as large as 20 run, as well as the high potential of inward leaks at interfaces. In terms of protective clothing and gloves, the subject is largely unexplored, maybe because of the common belief that skin is an impervious membrane and that protective clothing against chemical risks is efficient in case of exposure to nanoparticles.

A review might contain information about the user's experience with the app and opinion of it, feature requests and bug reports. Hence, reviews are valuable not only to users who would like to find out what others think about an app, but also to developers and software companies interested in customer feedback. The rapid increase in the number of applications and total app store revenue has accelerated app store data mining and opinion aggregation studies. While development companies and app store regulators have pursued upfront opinion mining studies for business intelligence and marketing purposes, research interest into app ecosystem and user reviews is relatively new. In addition to studies examining online product reviews, there are now some academic studies focused on mobile app stores and user reviews.

To facilitate heat loss and optimize performance, athletes can hasten body cooling prior (pre-cooling) or during (per-cooling) exercise. However, it is unclear whether per-cooling effect is the same on 'aerobic' and 'anaerobic' types of exercise (duration 76 seconds, respectively, according to Gastin [Sports Med 2001;31:725-741]) and whether the body area that is cooled makes a difference. Methods A literature search led to the identification of 1582 potential studies. Included studies had to include physical exercise with sufficient details on the type, duration, intensity, and provide valid performance measures and a cooling intervention administered during exercise with sufficient details on the type and site of application. Results Forty-five studies were included. Per-cooling provides a performance benefit during 'aerobic' (standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.60, P < .001) and 'anaerobic' exercises (SMD = 0.27, P < .02). The effects were greater during aerobic compared to anaerobic exercises (P < .01). Internal cooling (cold fluid ingestion such as cold water and ice slurry/menthol beverage) and external cooling (face, neck, and torso) provide the greatest performance benefit for 'aerobic' performance with a moderate to large effect (0.46 < SMD < 1.24). For 'anaerobic' exercises, wearing a whole-body cooling garment is the best way to enhance exercise performance (SMD = 0.39, P < .01). Conclusion Per-cooling improves 'aerobic' and 'anaerobic' exercise performance with a greater benefit for 'aerobic' exercise.

Its primary production is predominated by China via pyrometallurgical routes such as volatilization roasting-reduction smelting or direct reduction smelting. The performance of most of the pyro-processes is very sensitive to concentrate type and grade. Therefore, technology selection for a greenfield plant is a significant and delicate task to maximize the recovery rate of antimony and subsequently precious metals (PMs), mainly gold, from the concentrates. The current paper reviews the conventional pyrometallurgical processes and technologies that have been practiced for the treatment of antimony concentrates. The blast furnace is the most commonly used technology, mainly because of its adaptability to different feeds and grades and a high recovery rate. In addition, several other more environmentally friendly pyrometallurgical routes, that were recently developed, are reviewed but these are still at laboratory- or pilot-scales. For example, decarbonization of antimony production through the replacement of carbonaceous reductants with hydrogen seems to be feasible, although the process is still at its infancy, and further research and development are necessary for its commercialization. At the end, available refining methods for removal of the most important impurities including arsenic, sulfur, lead, iron, and copper from crude antimony are discussed.;\"[Moosavi-Khoonsari, Elmira] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St W, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Mostaghel, Sina] SNC Lavalin, 195 West Mall, Toronto, ON M9C 5K1, Canada; [Siegmund, Andreas] LanMetCon LLC, 780 Lark St, Lantana, TX 76226 USA; [Cloutier, Jean-Pierre] SNC Lavalin, 455 Rene Levesque Blvd, Montreal, PQ H2Z 1Z3, Canada\";;Moosavi-Khoonsari, E (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame St W, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;elmira.moosavi@etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2022;10;8;;;;;;;1590;10.3390/pr10081590;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr10081590;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000846967800001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Using the baseline subtraction approach, the signal from a defect free structure is subtracted from the actual monitoring signal to detect and characterize defects. Low frequency guided wave SHM and the interaction of the fundamental guided wave modes with various types of defect are well documented in the literature. There are, however, only a very limited number of studies on high order modes. High frequency guided waves may enable the detection of smaller cracks relative to conventional low frequency guided wave SHM. The main difficulty at high frequency is the existence of several modes with different velocities. This study investigates the scattering of high frequency Lamb waves around a through-thickness hole with a view to developing a highly sensitive SHM system for safety-critical components. A 3D finite element model of a 305 x 305 x 1.6 mm aluminum plate was used to determine the scattered field generated by cracks on the circumference of a through-thickness hole in the middle of the plate. Crack properties such as orientation, length and depth were studied. A subset of the finite element simulations were validated against experimental results. The experimental setup comprised a classic contact piezoelectric transducer bonded on the side of the plate and a laser interferometer detector.;\"[Travaglini, Christophe; Viens, Martin; Belanger, Pierre] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bescond, Christophe] CNR, Ottawa, ON, Canada\";;Belanger, P (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;pierre.belanger@etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2017;16;4;;;;;418;427;;10.1177/1475921716673567;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1475921716673567;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000404649500004;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

An ensemble effort estimation (EEE) technique combines several of the single/classical models found in the SDEE literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has yet been performed with a focus on the use of EEE techniques in SDEE. The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using the alkylating agent Temozolomide (TMZ) remain the mainstay of treatment for glioma. While this multimodal regimen is sufficient to temporarily eliminate the bulk of the tumor mass, recurrence is inevitable and often poses major challenges for clinical management due to treatment resistance and failure to respond to targeted therapies. Improved tumor pro filing capacity has enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of gliomas with the overarching goal to identify clinically relevant subtypes and inform treatment decisions. Increased tumor mutational load has been shown to correlate with higher levels of neoantigens and is indicative of the potential to induce a durable response to immunotherapy. Following treatment with TMZ, a subset of glioma has been identified to recur with increased tumor mutational load. These hypermutant recurrent glioma represent a subtype of recurrence with unique molecular vulnerabilities. In this review, we will elaborate on the current knowledge regarding the evolution of hypermutation in gliomas and the potential therapeutic opportunities that arise with TMZ-induced hypermutation in gliomas.;\"[Daniel, Paul; Chaddad, Ahmad; Abdulkarim, Bassam S.] McGill Univ, Div Radiat Oncol, Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sabri, Siham] McGill Univ, Dept Pathol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sabri, Siham; Jean-Claude, Bertrand; Rak, Janusz; Abdulkarim, Bassam S.] McGill Univ, Res Inst, Hlth Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chaddad, Ahmad] Ecole Technol Super, Lab Imagery Vis & Artificial Intelligence, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Meehan, Brian; Rak, Janusz] McGill Univ, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jean-Claude, Bertrand] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;\"Abdulkarim, BS (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Div Radiat Oncol, Dept Oncol, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Abdulkarim, BS (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Res Inst, Hlth Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada.\";bassam.abdulkarim@mcgill.ca;;;;;;;;83;84;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 4;2019;9;;;;;;;;41;10.3389/fonc.2019.00041;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2019.00041;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000457672000001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Dry and wet specimens were tested at tensile load-controlled cyclic loading with a stress ratio R = 0.1 and a load frequency of 7 Hz at room temperature (RT) and at 82celcius under different stress levels. Allowable stiffness change as a failure criterion was used to determine the delamination propagation onset threshold under cyclic tensile loading at each environmental condition. The delamination propagation onset was verified using the ultrasonic imaging (C-Scan) technique. The experimental results show that (1) fatigue life of CFRP specimens was more individually affected by moisture than by temperature and (2) combined moisture and temperature cause a drastic decrease in fatigue life. Finally, an investigation of the effect of hygrothermal conditions on stiffness degradation and damage of composite laminates subjected to tensile fatigue loading has been also carried. On the basis of the residual stiffness degradation, a damage variable was presented and phenomenological damage models were proposed by employing fatigue modulus and secant modulus concepts as measure of material damage.;\"[Khay, M.; Ngo, A.

However, purely FEM-based mechanical simulations require considerable time, limiting their use in clinical applications that require real-time responses, such as haptics simulators. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to help with the reduction of the required time. The present paper reviews cases where ML could help to generate faster simulations, without considerably affecting the performance results. Methods: This review details the ML approaches used, considering the anatomical structures involved, the data collection strategies, the selected ML algorithms, with corresponding features, the metrics used for validation, and the resulting time gains. Results: A total of 41 references were found. ML algorithms are mainly trained with FEM-based simulations in 32 publications. The preferred ML approach is neural networks, including deep learning in 35 publications. Tissue deformation is simulated in 18 applications, but other features are also considered. The average distance error and mean squared error are the most frequently used performance metrics, in 14 and 17 publications, respectively. The time gains were considerable, going from hours or minutes for purely FEM-based simulations to milliseconds, when using ML. Conclusions: ML algorithms can be used to accelerate FEM-based biomechanical simulations of anatomical structures, possibly reaching real-time responses. Fast and real-time simulations of anatomical structures, generated with ML algorithms, can help to reduce the time required by FEM-based simulations and accelerate their adoption in the clinical practice.

Traffic and environmental loadings cause distresses and damages in the pavement structure. A traditional approach for pavement rehabilitation is to implement an asphalt overlay on existing deteriorated bituminous pavement at specific times during its service life. However, this approach is somewhat expensive in the long run and not environmentally friendly. On the other hand, several studies indicate that the inclusion of a geosynthetic layer under an asphalt overlay leads to extended pavement service life. Nevertheless, there are still some discrepancies between fields and modeling results. These mainly stem from the fact that the mechanical behavior of reinforced asphalt overlay has not entirely been understood, which results in underestimate or overestimate design solutions. This paper first aims to review different aspects of mechanical interaction between geosynthetic material and asphalt overlay. Afterwards, essential considerations need to be considered in the design procedure to obtain an efficient reinforced-rehabilitated bituminous pavement structure are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Membranes produced from such systems are expected to have a high specific surface area (SSA; e.g., more than 50 m(2) g(-1)), an essential requirement for many of their applications. In spite of their advantages and potential, there are major issues regarding the electrospinning of NIPST systems that are not systematically addressed in the literature. In this paper, the most recent developments are reported and the potential and challenges associated with the electrospinning of NIPST systems are discussed. Furthermore, the essential steps to improve and optimize the electrospinning process of these systems are concisely discussed. By developing a modified time-dependent rheological model, a time range can be defined for NIPST systems as electrospinnability window, in which fiber functionality and characteristics can be tailored through aging of the systems prior to electrospinning. Some potential post-treatment processes are also proposed based on the results of recent studies to stabilize as-electrospun membranes without damaging their highly porous fibers, which can guarantee their in-service mechanical and morphological stability.\";\"[Rezabeigi, Ehsan] McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Wong Bldg,3610 Rue Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C5, Canada; [Demarquette, Nicole R.] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Genie Mecan, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Rezabeigi, E (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Min & Mat Engn, Wong Bldg,3610 Rue Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C5, Canada.;e.rezabeigi@gmail.com;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2019;40;9;;;;;;;1800880;10.1002/marc.201800880;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/marc.201800880;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000471988400004;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

The subject of dendritic growth has received much attention from both scientific and industrial points of view. On the one hand, dendritic growth has become a deeply investigated subject in non-linear dynamics field. On the other hand, its understanding became essential for some engineering applications, mainly in metallurgy and latent thermal energy storage where phase change materials are used. Therefore, understanding and modeling the mechanisms which result the dendritic structures has been the objective of much research over the last decades. In order to understand the formation of dendrites, it is essential to understand the physical mechanisms on the interface separating the two phases. This paper reviews and discusses the available theories of dendritic growth, and then introduces the Gibbs-Thomson condition which has to be taken into account to handle all interfacial effects. Based on the Gibbs-Thomson condition, a complete mathematical model describing the dendritic growth problem for pure substances is formulated. This model includes the heat equation in both liquid and solid phases, the heat conservation equation at the interface separating these two phases, and the proposed Gibbs-Thomson equation. In order to solve this complex non-linear problem, several numerical methods have been developed. Hence, in its last section, the paper reviews these numerical methods distinguishing between two major classes involving the explicit and the implicit tracking of the moving interface.;\"[Jaafar, Mohamad Ali; Rousse, Daniel R.] Ecole Technol Super, Ind Res Grp T3e, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jaafar, Mohamad Ali; Gibout, Stephane; Bedecarrats, Jean-Pierre] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Lab Therm Energet & Proc IPRA, EA1932, Rue Jules Ferry,BP7511, F-64075 Pau, France\";;Bedecarrats, JP (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Lab Therm Energet & Proc IPRA, EA1932, Rue Jules Ferry,BP7511, F-64075 Pau, France.;jean-pierre.bedecarrats@univ-pau.fr;;;;;;;;34;34;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2017;74;;;;;;1064;1079;;10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.050;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.02.050;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000401492900075;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

The thermomechanical treatment of Ti-Ni SMA comprising cold rolling (CR) and post-deformation annealing (PDA) forms a nanocrystalline structure (NCS) providing much higher functional properties than normal coarse-grained structure. The NCS consisting of grains surrounded by high-angle boundaries (nanograined structure, NGS) provides higher static shape memory properties than the NCS consisting of subgrains separated by low-angle (< 15 degrees) boundaries (nanosubgrained structure, NSS), whereas a mixed NS + NG structure provides the best functional fatigue properties. The following evolution of NCS types formed as a result of PDA is observed: when the CR strain increases from moderate (a true strain e about 0.3) to intermediate (e = 0.5-1) and then to severe (e > 1) levels, the NSS transforms to the mixed NSS + NGS and then to the NGS. The NS structures observed in Ti-Ni after intermediate or severe CR and after PDA do not significantly differ from each other in TEM images. This is due to the development of dynamic polygonization during CR which continues as the static polygonization during PDA. A moderate CR does not reach the dynamic polygonization stage, its dislocation substructure transforms to a statically polygonized NSS upon PDA.;\"[Prokoshkin, Sergey; Dubinskiy, Sergey] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Brailovski, Vladimir] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Prokoshkin, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia.;\"prokoshkin@tmo.misis.ru; dubinskiy.sm@misis.ru; vladimir.brailovski@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;10;11;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2019;5;4;;;;;336;345;;10.1007/s40830-019-00241-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40830-019-00241-6;;NOV 2019;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000496211600001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Several accidents were originated from the failure of heat exchangers and therefore, failure analysis for the root cause is inevitable to take precautionary measures for avoiding similar catastrophes. Proper regular online and offline inspections of heat exchangers are useful to predict the effectiveness and performance of the heat exchanger. Many leak inspection techniques are currently in use to identify the leaks in and around the tube-to-tubesheet joints. Review articles addressing the importance of tube-totubesheet joints and problems are scanty. Therefore, this review discusses the major root causes of heat exchanger failures and recommended preventive remedial measures followed by the leak inspection techniques relevant to the heat exchanger tube-to-tubesheet joints. The information discussed in the article is promising for researchers and professionals working in the field of heat exchangers.;\"[Thekkuden, Dinu Thomas; Mourad, Abdel-Hamid Ismail] United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mech Engn, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Mourad, Abdel-Hamid Ismail] United Arab Emirates Univ, Natl Water & Energy Ctr, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates; [Bouzid, Abdel-Hakim] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame Quest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Mourad, AHI (corresponding author), United Arab Emirates Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mech Engn, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.;ahmourad@uaeu.ac.ae;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2021;130;;;;;;;;105798;10.1016/j.engfailanal.2021.105798;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2021.105798;;OCT 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000711381600002;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

However, traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD, in this study, we conducted a literature review of studies published until February 14, 2020, using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases. A total of 209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in this review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data, types of data, machine learning methods and associated outcomes.

In this study, we performed a systematic mapping and review on SPMP studies to analyze and summarize the empirical evidence on the prediction accuracy of SPMP techniques in current research. Objective: The objective of this study is twofold: (1) to classify SPMP studies reported in the literature using the following criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, empirical approach, software application type, datasets, independent variables used as predictors, dependent variables (e.g. how maintainability is expressed in terms of the variable to be predicted), tools used to gather the predictors, the successful predictors and SPMP techniques, (2) to analyze these studies from three perspectives: prediction accuracy, techniques reported to be superior in comparative studies and accuracy comparison of these techniques. Methodology: We performed a systematic mapping and review of the SPMP empirical studies published from 2000 up to 2018 based on an automated search of nine electronic databases. Results: We identified 82 primary studies and classified them according to the above criteria. The mapping study revealed that most studies were solution proposals using a history-based empirical evaluation approach, the datasets most used were historical using object-oriented software applications, maintainability in terms of the independent variable to be predicted was most frequently expressed in terms of the number of changes made to the source code, maintainability predictors most used were those provided by Chidamber and Kemerer (C&K), Li and Henry (L&H) and source code size measures, while the most used techniques were ML techniques, in particular artificial neural networks. Detailed analysis revealed that fuzzy & neuro fuzzy (FNF), artificial neural network (ANN) showed good prediction for the change topic, while multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and group method of data handling (GMDH) techniques presented greater accuracy prediction in comparative studies. Based on our findings SPMP is still limited. Developing more accurate techniques may facilitate their use in industry and well-formed, generalizable results be obtained.

To address these issues, wireless network virtualization is seen as a key enabling technology for future networks. Virtualization offers cost-effective and efficient resource utilization by sharing the resources among multiple operators. Also, in contrast to traditional service specific inflexible network implementations, adoption of innovative network technologies demand certain level of flexibility and control over the networking fabric. In this respect, we argue that, for realizing a programmable and flexible heterogeneous virtual network infrastructure, software defined networking (SDN) & cloud computing technologies are the key tools to leverage on. This will ensure efficient resource utilization through sharing, enable programming of the underlying heterogeneous network infrastructure as a system and provide on-demand, elastic resource provisioning. In this paper, we lay out the key requirements and architectural components of end-to-end programmable heterogeneous virtual wireless networks (HVWNs). To report on the advances made in the pertinent technologies in realizing a HVWN architecture, we also present a brief survey of research on wireless network that leverage SDN, programmable radio plane and cloud computing technologies. We also investigate various actors and their roles in such HVWN environment and address various research issues and challenges in realizing such an architecture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed control system is primarily designed to stabilize a sprung mass position of the quarter car electrohydraulic active suspension. Linear controllers such as the proportional-integral-differential controller have limited control performances. The limited control performances are caused by dynamic phenomena such as nonlinearity, parametric uncertainties, and stiff external disturbances. To overcome these dynamic phenomena, we propose a combined adaptive radial basis function neural network with a backstepping control system for a quarter car active suspension system. This setup can handle the unmatched model uncertainty of the system, while the adaptive neural network can take care of its unknown smoothing functions. In general, radial basis function neural network can represent a complicated function, and therefore, semi-strict-feedback dynamic systems are considered to simplify the adaptive neural network control design.

However, existing systematic map and review studies on software development effort prediction have not investigated in depth several issues of ASEE techniques, to the exception of comparisons with other types of estimation techniques. Objective: The objective of this research is twofold: (1) to classify ASEE studies which primary goal is to propose new or modified ASEE techniques according to five criteria: research approach, contribution type, techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE steps, as well as identifying publication channels and trends and (2) to analyze these studies from five perspectives: estimation accuracy, accuracy comparison, estimation context, impact of the techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE tools. Method: We performed a systematic mapping of studies for which the primary goal is to develop or to improve ASEE techniques published in the period 1990-2012, and reviewed them based on an automated search of four electronic databases. Results: In total, we identified 65 studies published between 1990 and 2012, and classified them based on our predefined classification criteria. The mapping study revealed that most researchers focus on addressing problems related to the first step of an ASEE process, that is, feature and case subset selection. The results of our detailed analysis show that ASEE methods outperform the eight techniques with which they were compared, and tend to yield acceptable results especially when combining ASEE techniques with Fuzzy Logic (FL) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, the use of other techniques such FL and GA in combination with an ASEE method is promising to generate more accurate estimates. However, the use of ASEE techniques by practitioners is still limited: developing more ASEE tools may facilitate the application of these techniques and then lead to increasing the use of ASEE techniques in industry.

Such practices are presented in the literature as assessment requirements, success factors, observations, and lessons learned. Consequently, a set of 38 best practices has been collected and classified into five main categories, namely practices related to SPA methods, support tools, procedures, documentation, and users. While this collected set of best practices is important for designing lightweight as well as heavyweight assessment methods, it is of utmost importance in designing lightweight assessment methods, as the design of which depends on individual experience.

Filter technology for improving power quality of such loads has matured to a reasonable level. Moreover, hybrid filters are considered one of best options for improving power quality for a number of considerations. A comprehensive review of hybrid filters configurations is given: their control approaches, state of art, design considerations, selection criteria, potential applications, latest trends, future developments and their comparative features. A broad review of the status of hybrid filters to researchers, design and practice engineers dealing with power quality improvements is presented.

There are several options available for the design of a CSP plant, including collection technologies, solar thermal receivers, heat transfer fluids, and energy storage capacities. In this study, a techno-economic analysis has been conducted, considering the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) for each technology in order to build a common understanding and vision. The analysis outcomes were incorporated with the Saudi energy sector requirements and local weather conditions to define alternative scenarios. Six power plant scenarios were defined for performance and financial evaluation. This includes parabolic trough, solar tower, and linear Fresnel collection technologies. A simulation was subsequently carried out through the System Advisor Model (SAM). The alternative scenarios were assessed through defining weather, technical, and financial parameters. Satellite observations and field measured data were combined to obtain a typical meteorological year weather data for the capital city Riyadh. The SWOT analysis revealed that the parabolic trough collectors are the most mature and that they are adopted in a majority of operational CSP projects, which is a key factor at the early stages of CSP integration in Saudi Arabia. Solar towers are gaining popularity owing to their ability to incorporate high levels of energy storage. The simulation results depicted significant capacity factors per initial cost as well as annual energy for solar tower scenarios. The linear Fresnel technique is in its infancy for large-scale operations, yet the results showed a high potential, including the lowest levelized cost of energy compared to other scenarios. The findings of this research will help assess alternatives for CSP projects with consideration of all relevant criteria.;\"[Kassem, Abdulrahman] Concordia Univ, CIISE, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Al-Haddad, Kamal; Komljenovic, Dragan] ETS, 1100 Notre Dame St W, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Komljenovic, Dragan] Res Inst Hydroquebec IREQ, 1800 Blvd Lionel Boulet, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S1, Canada\";;Kassem, A (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, CIISE, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.;\"ab_kasse@encs.concordia.ca; kamal.al-haddad@etsmtl.ca; komljenovic.dragan@ireq.ca\";;;;;;;;47;47;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2017;80;;;;;;75;91;;10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.157;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.157;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000412787600006;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

The high content of metal oxides in steel slags gives them a great potential to adsorb CO2, reaching a saturation value of about 0.25 kg of CO2/kg of slag. CO2 is physisorbed and chemisorbed on the most of metal oxide types. Generally, the CO2 physisorption on the basic and amphoteric metal oxides involves an electrostatic interaction between the CO2 and the cation from the oxides while the CO2 chemisorption rather implicates the basic sites that acts as the electron donor, and which are associated with O2- ions localized at surface defects. These interactions result in the formation of carbonates (monodentates or unidentates and bidentates). The affinity of oxides for the CO2 and the carbonate formation principally depend of the strength and number of basic sites at their surface and varies as following: basic oxides > amphoteric oxides > acidic oxides. The basic metal oxides generally represent the best electron donors and thus the best CO2 adsorbents due to the high basicity and their great number of reaction sites. Hence, it appears that the surface structure of basic and amphoteric metal oxides which may favour their interaction with the CO2, as well as their basicity is the determinant factor contributing to the formation of carbonate species. The molecular analysis Of CO2 adsorption on steel slag metal oxides will provide useful data to identify rate-controlling mechanisms and should be considered for the development of new effective methods for the capture of atmospheric CO2 emissions released from industries.

Sleep studies have become an extensive approach serving as a diagnostic tool for health-care professionals. Currently, the gold standard is polysomnography (PSG) recorded in a sleep laboratory. However, it is obtrusive, requires qualified technicians, and is time and cost expensive. With the introduction of commercial off-the-shelf technologies in the medical field, alternatives to the conventional methods have been conceived to ensure sleep stages and sleep quality detection, which may be now used at home on several nights. Cardio respiratory and physical activities abide the most promising physiological measurements to detect sleep stages without complete PSG. The statistically proven impacts and budgets related to sleep disorders are phenomenal, showing that the field needs more research. This paper aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective by presenting a review of research literature on developments made in unobtrusive sleep assessment. Additionally, a categorization of current approaches is presented based on methodological considerations, from data acquisition frameworks and physiological measurements, to information processing.

Many techniques have been proposed in the literature to substantially decrease the peaks in the OFDM signal. The problem with these, however, is that their effects on other parameters are not always positive. These effects include a decrease in the bit error rate (BER), an increase in complexity, or a reduction in the bit rate. The objective of this paper is to describe the PAPR problem in a bid to reduce the peaks in the OFDM signal. The paper proposes a classification, performance evaluation and optimization of PAPR reduction techniques for commercial, public safety, and tactical applications.

However, conceptual studies on integration in IPD literature are scattered and fragmented, that is, most of the studies only focused on the segmented dimension of integration. A systemic understanding of the concepts of integration in IPD project-based context is still lacking. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes two aspects of integration (dimensions and directions) in IPD literature and explores their extent in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach Grounded theory review and focus group discussion approaches were employed to perform a thorough conceptual review of the literature, frame the research into the theory and increase the fundamental understanding of the concept of integration in IPD literature. Findings In this study, IPD integrating techniques were identified and their integration dimensions and directions were discussed. Results show that integration in the project-based environment of IPD is a multidimensional construct. Based on organizational, contractual and operational characteristics of IPD projects, twenty-four integration mechanisms were identified and framed into seven clusters. The integration directions over project life-cycle were demonstrated in three contexts: (1) an on-site construction project, delivered traditionally, (2) an on-site construction project, delivered with IPD and (3) an off-site construction project, delivered with IPD. Originality/value This paper gathers the segments of integration into a comprehensive overview, which can help researchers and practitioners explore elements of IPD project success more precisely. A theoretical framework of integration clusters is developed, based on IPD literature. The impact of IPD on on-site versus off-site construction is illustrated from an integration direction perspective.

This allows extracting its material properties for engineering design and research purposes. The main objective of the study is preparing a consistent set of material properties for unidirectional flax fiber-reinforced epoxy composite with defined composition and basic configuration. These data are prerequisites for growing researches on flax fiber-reinforced epoxy composites, especially for numerical analysis purposes using the finite element method. In this work, partially green unidirectional-flax fiber-reinforced epoxy composites are tested for physical and mechanical properties and studied for their failure modes. Tension, compression, flexion, and shear properties, as well as physical properties like density, specific heat capacity and thermal diffusivity, are evaluated according to ASTM standard test methods. Flax fibers, which are composites by themselves, come in bundles in the composites and demonstrate a complex behavior.

To conduct burr removal from machined edges and holes, the costly and non-desirable secondary operation, so-called deburring, is demanded. The complexity and severity of deburring processes depend on several factors, including burr size, location, and the material to be deburred. Due to vast applications of aluminum alloys in numerous manufacturing sectors including automotive and aerospace industries, adequate knowledge of the most widely used deburring processes on aluminum alloys is demanded. However, surprisingly, despite the acute demands by numerous manufacturing sectors, no state of the art was found in the open literature about applicable deburring and edge-finishing methods for aluminum work parts. This lack is intended to be remedied in this work by providing an insight into the most widely used deburring and edge-finishing processes for aluminum work parts. To that end, several deburring classifications were proposed. The main highly used category of deburring techniques is mechanical deburring process which is related to the removal of various kinds of burr shapes and size by means of mechanical abrasion. In fact, mechanical deburring processes are the most widely used techniques due to versatility, flexibility, deburring rate, and acceptable cost. Among mechanical deburring methods, several methods including robotic, CNC, and manual deburring were presented in this work. A brief insight into the application of several other non-classified mechanical deburring processes was also presented. In addition, knowing that an accurate selection of deburring methods is highly dependent to proper understanding of the burr formation, therefore, an overview of burr formation mechanism, morphology, shape, and, in principle, those factors governing burr formation are also presented, followed by experimental, numerical, and analytical models of burr formation morphology and size. Other general concerns, including the use of lubricant and its effects on deburring performance, must be identified. The future demands of precision deburring are challenging, not only for machine tools and deburring tools, but also for high-precision machining researchers. Close collaborations between machine tool builders, CAD/CAM programmers for precision tool path planning, and deburring and edge-finishing R & D community are highly demanded towards the successful movement to the next generation of precision deburring and edge finishing.;\"[Niknam, Seyed Ali; Davoodi, Behnam] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Sustainable Mfg Res Lab, Tehran, Iran; [Paulo Davim, J.] Univ Aveiro, Dept Mech Engn, Aveiro, Portugal; [Songmene, Victor] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;Niknam, SA (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Sustainable Mfg Res Lab, Tehran, Iran.;\"saniknam@iust.ac.ir; bdavoodi@iust.ac.ir; pdavim@ua.pt; victor.songmene@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;21;21;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2018;95;1-4;;;;;1101;1125;;10.1007/s00170-017-1288-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-017-1288-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000425947800084;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

This contribution examines the state of research and practice of ML for its applications to wind engineering. In addition to ML applications to wind climate, terrain/topography, aerodynamics/aeroelasticity and structural dynamics (following traditional Alan G.

This state-of-the-art review suggests to what extend ML has been utilized in each of these topic areas within wind engineering and provides a comprehensive summary to improve understanding how learning algorithms work and when these schemes succeed or fail.

These AAEMs greatly affect the thermal conversion of biomass, although their effects are only partly understood. Furthermore, while coal currently plays a major role in global energy demand, its massive use in a carbon-constrained world has prompted the need to identify alternative and carbon-neutral energy sources. In this context, the co-pyrolysis of biomass with coal has been shown to be a promising way to support the transition from fossil to renewable energy carriers. Because AAEMs can significantly impact such a co-processing approach, there is therefore the need for a firm understanding of their catalytic role. Consequently, and to examine and summarize the main research advances that have been made in this field, the present review first covers a description of the main properties of lignocellulosic biomass and coal, along with their decomposition processes. It then focuses on AAEM catalysts and on their impact on pyrolysis reaction pathways and kinetics. In terms of highlights, the review illustrates that the presence of inherent or impregnated AAEMs shifts the decomposition of biomass to lower temperatures while increasing the char and gas yields at the expense of bio-oil. Moreover, these effects depend significantly on the nature of the catalyst considered and on the way it is mixed with biomass. As examples, potassium tends to favor the production of low molecular weight compounds and gaseous species, magnesium promotes dehydration reactions, whereas calcium and magnesium oxides allow to upgrade volatiles by deoxygenation and deacidification. A discussion of pyrolysis reaction mechanisms is also proposed by reviewing the different pathways involved in the decomposition of the main components of biomass and coal, noting that the emphasis is particularly on the changes induced by AAEM catalysts. The synergistic effects between coal and biomass which are likely to enhance the co-pyrolysis process are then discussed. Eventually, a comprehensive reaction pathway is proposed to better explain the important role played by AAEM catalysts during primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions.;\"[Wang, Wei; Lemaire, Romain] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Wang, Wei; Bensakhria, Ammar] Univ Technol Compiegne, Ctr Rech Royallieu, EA 4297, TIMR, BP20529, F-60205 Compiegne, France; [Luart, Denis] Ecole Super Chim Organ & Minerale, 1 Rue Reseau Jean Marie Buckmaster, F-60200 Compiegne, France\";;Lemaire, R (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;romain.lemaire@etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2022;163;;;;;;;;105479;10.1016/j.jaap.2022.105479;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.105479;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000805455600008;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

This method is said to reduce installation costs and facilitate installation, especially for nested piezometers. The success of a fully grouted installation depends upon the ratio of grout and surrounding soil hydraulic conductivity and upon the grout physical stability. This article presents new results from field tests and numerical simulations regarding the performance of fully grouted piezometers under transient flow conditions. The field observations show that using low-permeability grout for piezometer installation provides precise pore water pressure (PWP) measurements. This confirms previous findings on the fully grouted installation technique. Field observations for a very high-permeability grout that could be more than 1,100 times more permeable than the soil result in PWPs that totally differ from the PWP obtained with a low-permeability grout. Using three scenarios involving transient flow, the numerical results show that hydraulic conductivity ratios between 0.001 and 10 provide an accurate pore pressure response without a significant time lag for soils with a very low permeability (K <= 2 x 10(-9) m/s). For most practical applications, a hydraulic conductivity ratio of 100 is the upper limit to obtain acceptable pore pressure measurements for these soils. A large hydraulic conductivity ratio may cause a hydraulic short circuit between the fully grouted piezometer and the upper aquifer. For a borehole diameter of 100 mm, the numerical results demonstrate that grout stiffness has no significant impact on the performance of fully grouted piezometers. However, grout stiffness is important for the long-term performance of the fully grouted piezometer. This article also introduces preliminary results regarding a testing program on grout properties. These results confirm pervious findings by others that the preparation of low-permeability grout is not trivial and that grout initial viscosity controls its physical stability and hydraulic conductivity.;\"[Marefat, Vahid] Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept CGM, POB 6079,Stn CV, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Marefat, Vahid; Duhaime, Francois] Ecole Technol Super, Lab Geotech & Geoenvironm Engn LG2, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Chapuis, Robert P.] Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept CGM, POB 6079,Stn CV, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Le Borgne, Vincent] GKM Consultants, 2141 Rue Nobel, St Julie, PQ J3E 1Z9, Canada\";;\"Marefat, V (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Montreal, Dept CGM, POB 6079,Stn CV, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.;Marefat, V (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Lab Geotech & Geoenvironm Engn LG2, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.\";vahid.marefat@polymtl.ca;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2019;42;2;;;;;433;456;;10.1520/GTJ20170290;http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/GTJ20170290;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000464855100010;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

This increasing trend in extreme rainfall is seen in both the observational record and climate model projections. However, a thorough review of the recent scientific literature paints a complex picture in which the intensification of rainfall extremes depends on a multitude of factors. While some projected rainfall indices follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship scaling of an similar to 7% increase in rainfall per 1 degrees C of warming, there is substantial evidence that this scaling depends on rainfall extremes frequency, with longer return period events seeing larger increases, leading to super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in some cases. The intensification of extreme rainfall events is now well documented at the daily scale but is less clear at the subdaily scale. In recent years, climate model simulations at a finer spatial and temporal resolution, including convection-permitting models, have provided more reliable projections of subdaily rainfall. Recent analyses indicate that rainfall scaling may also increase as a function of duration, such that shorter-duration, longer return period events will likely see the largest rainfall increases in a warmer climate. This has broad implications on the design and the use of rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, for which both an overall increase in magnitude and a steepening can now be predicted. This paper also presents an overview of measures that have been adopted by various governing bodies to adapt IDF curves to the changing climate. Current measures vary from multiplying historical design rainfall by a simple constant percentage to modulating correction factors based on return periods and to scaling them to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship based on projected temperature increases. All of these current measures fail to recognize a possible super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall and, perhaps more importantly, the increasing scaling toward shorter-duration rainfall and the most extreme rainfall events that will significantly impact stormwater runoff in cities and in small rural catchments. This paper discusses the remaining scientific gaps and offers technical recommendations for practitioners on how to adapt IDF curves to improve climate resilience.;\"[Martel, Jean-Luc; Brissette, Francois P.; Troin, Magali; Arsenault, Richard] Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, 1100 Notre Dame West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Lucas-Picher, Philippe] Univ Toulouse, Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol, Ctr Natl Rech Sci,Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & C, 42 Ave Gaspard Coriolis, F-31057 Toulouse 1, France; [Troin, Magali] HydroClimatlTVT, Maison Numer & Innovat,Pl Georges Pompidou, F-83000 Toulon, France\";;Martel, JL (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, 1100 Notre Dame West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;\"jean-luc.martel@etsmtl.ca; francois.brissette@etsmtl.ca; philippe.lucas-picher@meteo.fr; magali.troin@hydroclimat.com; richard.arsenault@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;7;7;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 1;2021;26;10;;;;;;;3121001;10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002122;http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002122;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000686129700001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Chatter detection in this situation is a crucial step for improving surface quality and reducing both noise and rapid wear of the cutting tool. This paper proposes a new methodology for the chatter detection in computer numerical control milling machines. This methodology is based on vibratory signal analysis and artificial intelligence. The methodology consists of five major steps: (1) data acquisition, (2) signal processing, (3) features generation, (4) features selection and (5) classification. As chatter components occur around system resonance frequencies, a multiband resonance filtering method is proposed at the processing step. The process is then followed by envelope analysis. This allows the signal-to-noise ratio to be increased and the sensitivity of generated features to be increased. Extracted features are then ranked based on their entropy in which only best features are selected and presented to the system for classification. At the classification step, the selected features are classified into two classes: stable and unstable utilizing neural networks. Two neural network approaches, radial basis function and multi-layer perceptrons, are tested. The developed approach is applied for chatter detection in a Huron K2X10 milling machine.

New data of laminar burning velocity for three fuel blends containing up to 75% alcohol by liquid volume are also provided. From these new experimental data, a correlation to estimate the laminar burning velocity of any butanol or ethanol blend iso-octane-air mixture is proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Melts were Sr-modified and grain-refined. Hydrogen content was varied from less than 0.1 ml/100 g Al to similar to 0.4 ml/100 g Al; Fe was increased to 0.8% in B319 alloy. Lanthanum and cerium were added as 99.5% pure metals. Two main techniques were used to investigate porosity formation: fracture surface of tensile or fatigue test bars, or reduced pressure test (RPT) method. Porosity type and shape were examined. The results show that pore size is more influential than small scattered ones from a mechanical point of view. Tensile testing is affected by porosity located at the center of the testing bar, whereas edge porosity is responsible for crack initiation in case of fatigue testing. Intermetallics precipitate in the form of intercepted platelets which restricts the flow of the molten metal, leading to formation of shrinkage cavities. Precipitation of clusters of compounds from the liquid state such as Al2Si2Sr, Mg2Sn, Al3Ti, or added Al(2)O(3)particles would as well act as nucleation sites for porosity formation. Most oxides were observed in the form of long branched strings.

The building roofs are the main sources of undesirable heat for buildings, especially in warm climates. This paper discusses the use and application of white roofing material in emerging economies. The use of white roofing material is a suggestion because of its cooling, evaporative and efficiency characteristics compared to traditional black roofing materials. Many research studies have shown that the darker roofing surfaces that are prevalent in many urban areas actually can increase temperature by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius to the environment surrounding these urban areas. Additionally, improved temperature control and heat reflection also work to reduce the energy requirements for the interior spaces of the structures that have white roofing surfaces. The white or lighter colored roofs tend to reflect a part of the solar radiation that strikes the roof's surface. Consequently, one might believe that white roofing material would be commonplace and especially so within emerging economies. Yet, this is hardly the case at all. This paper examines the issue of white roofing materials in emerging economies from a dual perspective. The dual perspective includes the technical details of white roofing material and its impact on lowering the interior temperature of the affected structures, which consequently reduces hours of indoor thermal discomfort and use of air conditioners in indoor spaces. The other element in this study, however, involves the marketing aspect of white roofing material. This includes its adoption, acceptance and cost-benefit in emerging economies.;\"[Al Fayad, Fadye] Jubail Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm, Royal Commiss Jubail, Al Jubail 35716, Saudi Arabia; [Maref, Wahid] Univ Quebec, Construct Engn Dept, Ecole Technol Super ETS, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Awad, Mohamed M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Power Mech Engn, Fac Engn, Mansoura 35516, Egypt\";;Al Fayad, F (corresponding author), Jubail Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm, Royal Commiss Jubail, Al Jubail 35716, Saudi Arabia.;\"Fayadf@ucj.edu.sa; Wahid.Maref@etsmtl.ca; m_m_awad@mans.edu.eg\";;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2021;13;17;;;;;;;9967;10.3390/su13179967;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13179967;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000694517400001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

The use of traditional orthogonal multiple access techniques limits the number of users that can be served using available resources due to orthogonality constraint. Moreover, the available resources may not be utilized effectively by alloted users thereby resulting in inefficiency and user unfairness. This imposes a severe drawback in cases where the number of users to be served are high, like in the Internet of Things or ultra-dense 5G networks. Hence, introducing non-orthogonality to multiple access scheme is advocated as a superior methodology to serve multiple users simultaneously, thereby achieving multi-fold enhancement in connectivity. In scenarios with massive number of users, non-orthogonal multiple access scheme (NOMA) increases the number of active connections by superimposing signals of multiple users on the same resource block, thereby also utilizing the available resources efficiently.

Liver volume is assessed primarily via organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The goal of this paper is to provide an accessible overview of liver segmentation targeted at radiologists and other healthcare professionals. Methods Using images from CT and MRI, this paper reviews the indications for liver segmentation, technical approaches used in segmentation software and the developing roles of liver segmentation in clinical practice. Results Liver segmentation for volumetric assessment is indicated prior to major hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and transplant. Segmentation software can be categorised according to amount of user input involved: manual, semi-automated and fully automated. Manual segmentation is considered the gold standard in clinical practice and research, but is tedious and time-consuming. Increasingly automated segmentation approaches are more robust, but may suffer from certain segmentation pitfalls. Emerging applications of segmentation include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers. Conclusions Liver segmentation has multiple clinical applications and is expanding in scope. Clinicians can employ semi-automated or fully automated segmentation options to more efficiently integrate volumetry into clinical practice. Teaching points Liver volume is assessed via organ segmentation on CT and MRI examinations. Liver segmentation is used for volume assessment prior to major hepatic procedures.

As part of the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a major public health problem, the CAD system provides a neuropsychological assessment that helps mitigate its effects. The use of data fusion techniques by CAD systems has proven to be useful, they allow for the merging of information relating to the brain and its tissues from MRI, with that of other types of modalities. This multimodal fusion refines the quality of brain images by reducing redundancy and randomness, which contributes to improving the clinical reliability of the diagnosis compared to the use of a single modality. The purpose of this article is first to determine the main steps of the CAD system for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Then to bring together some research work related to the diagnosis of brain disorders, emphasizing AD. Thus the most used methods in the stages of classification and brain regions segmentation are described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, on the basis of the raised problem, we propose a solution within the framework of multimodal fusion. In this context, based on quantitative measurement parameters, a performance study of multimodal CAD systems is proposed by comparing their effectiveness with those exploiting a single MRI modality. In this case, advances in information fusion techniques in medical imagery are accentuated, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

We believe that cloud computing technology can substantially change the way we respond to a DDoS attack, based on a number of new characteristics, which were introduced with the advent of this technology. We first present a new taxonomy of DDoS mitigation strategies to organize the work. Then, we go on to discuss the main features of existing DDoS mitigation strategies and explain their functionalities in the cloud environment. Afterwards, we show how the existing DDoS mechanisms fit into the network topology of the cloud. Finally, we discuss some of these DDoS mechanisms in detail, and compare their behavior in the cloud. Our objective is to show how these characteristics bring a novel perspective to existing DDoS mechanisms, and so give researchers new insights into how to mitigate DDoS attacks in the cloud computing.

The snowball technique was also used to examining the references listed in research articles initially identified with the databases. RESULTS: A total of 19 contextual factors were identified as having the potential to influence the OHS and productivity leverage of equipment innovations. The most often cited among these factors are the level of training provided to the equipment operators, operator experience and age, supervisor leadership abilities, and maintaining good relations within work crews. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between these factors are not discussed in mining innovation literature. It would be helpful to use a systems thinking approach which incorporates interaction between relevant actors and factors to define properly the most sensitive aspects of innovation management as it applies to mining equipment.;\"[Trudel, Bryan; Nadeau, Sylvie] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Zaras, Kazimierz] Univ Quebec Abitibi Temiscamingue, Dept Management, Rouyn Noranda, PQ, Canada; [Deschamps, Isabelle] Ecole Polytech, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada\";;Trudel, B (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;Bryan.Trudel@uqat.ca;;;;;;;;4;5;;;;;;;;;;;;2015;51;4;;;;;731;746;;10.3233/WOR-152033;http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/WOR-152033;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000361411000010;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Eight models with different levels of complexity are then selected to simulate daily precipitation for 35 stations across the world. All 8 models adequately reproduce the observed mean precipitation at daily, monthly and annual scales, while all of them underestimate the standard deviation of monthly and annual precipitation. However, the compound distributions are generally better than the single distributions at reducing the variance overdispersion, with the exception of the skewed normal (SN) distribution. The nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) is consistently better than all the parametric distributions. With the exception of the SN distribution, all the single distributions underestimate the upper tail of daily precipitation distribution. However, the generalized Pareto distribution- based compound distributions provide a reasonable performance for simulating the upper tail, even though they are slightly worse than the KDE, which displays the best performance. Overall, the compound distributions generally perform better than the single distributions, and the nonparametric KDE performs better than the parametric distributions. However, the complicated structure of the compound distribution and of the KDE and the limited extrapolation ability of the KDE may restrict their application to climate change impact studies. The 3-parameter SN distribution displays a similar or even slightly better performance than the compound distributions, and this distribution may be the first choice to be incorporated into a weather generator for studying climate change impacts, especially for risk-related assessments.;\"[Chen, Jie] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie; Brissette, Francois P.] Univ Quebec, Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Chen, J (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;jie.chen.1@ens.etsmtl.ca;;;;;;;;23;24;;;;;;;;;;;;2014;59;3;;;;;189;U45;;10.3354/cr01214;http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01214;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000335828100002;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

A literature review was carried out on 21 scientific publications in which the Two-Zone model was used to assess occupational exposure to solvent vapors. Data on exposure scenarios, solvents, generation/emission rates, near- and far-field parameters, and model performance were collected and analyzed. Over the 24 exposure scenarios identified, 18 were evaluated under controlled conditions, 5 under normal workplace activities, and 1 was reported based on literature data. The scenarios involved a variety of tasks which consisted, mostly, of cleaning metal parts, spraying solvents onto surfaces, spilling liquids, and filling containers with volatile substances. Twenty-eight different solvents were modeled and the most commonly tested were benzene, toluene, and acetone. Emission rates were considered constant in 16 scenarios, exponentially decreasing in 6 scenarios, and intermittent in 2 scenarios. Four-hundred-and-forty-six (446) predicted-to-measured concentration ratios were calculated across the 21 studies; 441 were obtained in controlled conditions, 4 under normal workplace activities, and 1 was calculated based on the literature data. For controlled studies, the Two-Zone model predictive performance was within a factor of 0.3-3.7 times the measured concentrations with 93% of the values between 0.5 and 2. The model overestimated the measured concentrations in 63% of the evaluations. The median predicted concentration for the near-field was 1.38 vs. 1.02 for the far-field. Results suggest that the model might be a useful tool for predicting occupational exposure to vapors of solvents by providing a conservative approach. Harmonization in model testing strategies and data presentation is needed in future studies to improve the assessment of the predictability of the Two-Zone model. Moreover, this review has provided a database of exposure scenarios, input parameter values, and model predictive performances which can be useful to occupational hygienists in their future modeling activities.\";\"[Abattan, Spero Franck; Lavoue, Jerome; Drolet, Daniel; Debia, Maximilien] Univ Montreal, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, 2375 Chemin Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1A8, Canada; [Abattan, Spero Franck; Drolet, Daniel; Debia, Maximilien] Ctr Publ Hlth Res CReSP, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Halle, Stephane] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bahloul, Ali] Inst Rech Robert Sauve Sante & Securit Travail IR, Chem & Biol Hazards Prevent, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lavoue, Jerome] Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal Res Ctr CRCHUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;Debia, M (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm & Occupat Hlth, 2375 Chemin Cote Ste Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 1A8, Canada.;maximilien.debia@umontreal.ca;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 1;2021;18;2;;;;;51;64;;10.1080/15459624.2020.1861283;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1861283;;DEC 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000605687600001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

However, the multiphase machine requires high-performance control strategies to take advantage of these features. From this perspective, the field-oriented control with the inner current control loop that uses using an explicit modulation stage has been considered the benchmark solution thanks to the reduced harmonic distortion obtained with this regulation strategy. Nevertheless, nonlinear controllers, thanks to their inherent nature, allow exploiting the extra multiphase capabilities in a simplified manner. Consequently, this paper aims to concentrate and discuss the latest developments on nonlinear current control of two of the most popular multiphase electric drive configurations, five-phase and six-phase. Then, this paper covers mainly finite-control-set model predictive control and their variations. Moreover, sliding-mode control is also explained.

In this review, we summarized and discussed the radiomic techniques used for ASD analysis. Currently, the limited radiomic work of ASD is related to the variation of morphological features of brain thickness that is different from texture analysis. These techniques are based on imaging shape features that can be used with predictive models for predicting ASD. This review explores the progress of ASD-based radiomics with a brief description of ASD and the current non-invasive technique used to classify between ASD and healthy control (HC) subjects. With AI, new radiomic models using the deep learning techniques will be also described.

The increment in seismic losses is mainly due to the rapid growth of exposure and population in earthquake-prone areas worldwide. This phenomenon necessitates better understanding and accurate prediction of potential seismic risks to plan appropriate emergency response, rescue and recovery activities. The focus of the research community has shifted towards the prediction of the seismic risk, which paved way to the development of a number of modelling software. This paper presents a critical review of existing methods for seismic risk analysis and software developed by various organisations with an emphasis on their strength and limitations. First, the focus is on the essential assessment steps in seismic risk analysis, namely, hazard, exposure model and vulnerability assessment. Particular attention is paid to different approaches applied for vulnerability evaluation. The main advantages and disadvantages of each software are highlighted. Finally, a comparative analysis of major seismic risk software, such as HAZUS, Ergo, SELENA, OpenQuake and ER2, is provided. Findings of this review indicate unresolved issues in scenario loss modelling and probabilistic seismic risk assessment, such as the convergence problem in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, selection of suitable ground motion prediction equation and consideration of epistemic uncertainty, which need to be further investigated and applied to future seismic risk assessments.;\"[Hosseinpour, Vahid; Saeidi, Ali] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Appl Sci, Saguenay, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Nollet, Marie-Jose] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Nastev, Miroslav] Nat Resources Canada, Geol Survey Canada, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada\";;Hosseinpour, V (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Appl Sci, Saguenay, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.;Vahid.Hosseinpour1@uqac.ca;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;APR 1;2021;232;;;;;;;;111866;10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.111866;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.111866;;JAN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000623076400003;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Applying information and communication technologies to power systems makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions in the residential sector, for example through the development of smart homes. Smart homes are more energy efficient and thus, they may be prone to the rebound effect (RE), (i.e., an increase in demand following the introduction of more efficient technology). Moreover, because the electricity's environmental impacts, cost and demand all vary over time, the potential for RE may also fluctuate. Accounting for these temporal aspects could therefore provide more insights into how and why potential RE may occur in smart homes, especially with regard to households' behaviours. In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate standard and smart home electricity consumption. Life cycle assessment and environmentally extended input-output tables are used to calculate the households' electricity consumption and RE GHG emissions during the simulations. Results show that, while indirect RE in smart homes is low (about 5% in the simulations), the choice of metric used for smart electricity management is key to maximize the GHG emissions reductions of smart homes. When smart homes perform load shifting based on an economic rather than environmental signal, RE increases by almost five-fold. Moreover, certain periods, such as weekdays or the winter season, lead to more significant RE. Thus, considering factors that decrease RE could enable smart homes to reach their full potential contribution to sustainability.;\"[Walzberg, Julien; Dandres, Thomas; Samson, Rejean] Polytech Montreal, CP 6079 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada; [Merveille, Nicolas] Univ Quebec Montreal, Case Postale 8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Cheriet, Mohamed] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Merveille, Nicolas; Cheriet, Mohamed; Samson, Rejean] Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Sustainabil Operational, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;Walzberg, J (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, CP 6079 Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada.;julien.walzberg@polymtl.ca;;;;;;;;15;15;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2020;125;;;;;;;;109798;10.1016/j.rser.2020.109798;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109798;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000525862700006;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

This work is intended to offer a brief introduction to all such details with references to the most influential contributions in the field for those interested in a deeper understanding of the material.;\"[Abdolvand, Reza] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dynam Microsyst Lab, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Bahreyni, Behraad] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Mechatron Syst Engn, Surrey, BC V3T 0A3, Canada; [Lee, Joshua E. -Y.] City Univ Hong Kong, State Key Lab Millimeter Waves, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nabki, Frederic] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Bahreyni, B (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Mechatron Syst Engn, Surrey, BC V3T 0A3, Canada.;\"reza@ece.ucf.edu; bba19@sfu.ca; josh.lee@cityu.edu.hk; frederic.nabki@etsmtl.ca\";;;;;;;;115;115;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2016;7;9;;;;;;;160;10.3390/mi7090160;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi7090160;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000385483000015;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

To manage such changes and ensure software quality, modern code review is broadly adopted as a common and effective practice. Yet several open-source as well as commercial software projects have adopted peer code review as a crucial practice to ensure the quality of their software products using modern tool-based code review. Nevertheless, the selection of peer reviewers is still merely a manual and hard task especially with the growing size of distributed development teams. Indeed, it has been proven that inappropriate peer reviewers selection can consume more time and effort from both developers and reviewers and increase the development costs and time to market. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-objective search-based approach, named WhoReview, to find the optimal set of peer reviewers for code changes. We use the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) to find the best set of code reviewers that are (1) most experienced with the code change to be reviewed, while (2) considering their current workload, i.e., the number of open code reviews they are working on. We conduct an empirical study on 4 long-lived open source software projects to evaluate our approach. The obtained results show that WhoReview outperforms state-of-the-art approach by an average precision of 68% and recall of 77%. Moreover, we deployed our approach in an industrial context and evaluated it qualitatively from developers perspective. Results show the effectiveness of our approach with a high acceptance ratio in identifying relevant reviewers. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Frameworks describing the mechanical behavior of the aortic wall already exist. However, intraluminal thrombus nonhomogeneous structure and porosity still need to be well characterized. Also, although the morphology and mechanical properties of calcifications have been investigated, their effects on wall stresses remain controversial. Computational fluid dynamics usually assumes a rigid artery wall, whereas fluid-structure interaction accounts for artery compliance but is still challenging since arteries and blood have similar densities. We discuss alternatives to fluid-structure interaction based on dynamic medical images that address patient-specific hemodynamics and geometries. We describe initial stresses, elastic boundary conditions, and statistical strength for rupture risk assessment. Special emphasis is accorded to workflow development, from the conversion of medical images into finite element models, to the simulation of catheter-aorta interactions and stent-graft deployment.

Unlike the conventional complexity-based cryptographic techniques at the upper layers, physical layer security exploits the characteristics of wireless channels, e.g., fading, noise, interference, etc., to enhance wireless security. It is proved that secure transmission can benefit from fading channels. Accordingly, numerous researchers have explored what fading can offer for physical layer security, especially the investigation of physical layer security over wiretap fading channels. Therefore, this paper aims at reviewing the existing and ongoing research works on this topic. More specifically, we present a classification of research works in terms of the four categories of fading models: (i) small-scale, (ii) large-scale, (iii) composite, and (iv) cascaded. To elaborate these fading models with a generic and flexible tool, three promising candidates, including the mixture gamma (MG), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and Fox's H-function distributions, are comprehensively examined and compared. Their advantages and limitations are further demonstrated via security performance metrics, which are designed as vivid indicators to measure how perfect secrecy is ensured. Two clusters of secrecy metrics, namely (i) secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the lower bound of SOP; and (ii) the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity (PNZ), the intercept probability, average secrecy capacity (ASC), and ergodic secrecy capacity, are displayed and, respectively, deployed in passive and active eavesdropping scenarios. Apart from those, revisiting the secrecy enhancement techniques based on Wyner's wiretap model, the on-off transmission scheme, jamming approach, antenna selection, and security region are discussed.\";\"[Kong, Long; Lei, Lei; Chatzinotas, Symeon; Ottersten, Bjorn] Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Ai, Yun] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, N-2815 Gjovik, Norway; [Lei, Lei] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Kaddoum, Georges] Univ Quebec, Dept Elect Engn, LaCIME Lab, Ecole Technol Super ETS, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada\";;Kong, L (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;long.kong@uni.lu;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 4;2021;2021;1;;;;;;;194;10.1186/s13638-021-02065-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13638-021-02065-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000726282300001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Solar events such as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), solar flares and associated recombination events are one of the driving factors in space weather and the solar wind intensity. Even though it is located at such a great distance from our nearest star, the Earth and its associated satellites are still directly affected by variances in these space weather phenomena. On the surface of the planet, nowhere is this more immediate and important than with the terrestrial power grid, which is responsible for delivering electrical power to much of the planets population. Large-scale variations in solar activity can result in potentially devastating effects on the terrestrial power grid and the associated infrastructure. A team project was undertaken at the International Space University (ISU) Space Studies Program (SSP) 2013 to categorize and mitigate the risks involved in such a solar event. As part of this research, which included risk assessment for satellite, spacecraft and terrestrial resources, this paper presents a review of the terrestrial power grid and its inherent susceptibility to such phenomena. Mitigation schemes, techniques and approaches ranging from adaption of the existing power grid to alternative systems are considered in this paper, which allow for continued electrical power delivery and transmission, even in the face of such detrimental space weather effects.

Permanent ice loss is causing reductions to dry season streamflow, which is coupled with shifting demands and control over water access and entitlements in the region. A full evaluation of hydrologic inputs is required to inform future water management in the relative absence of glaciers. Over the last decade, new studies have shown groundwater to be a significant component of the regional water budget during the dry season, and it cannot be ignored when accounting for water quality and quantity downstream of the Cordillera Blanca's alpine catchments. Distinctive common features of the Cordillera Blanca's proglacial catchments are sediment-filled valleys that were once under proglacial lake conditions. The combination of lake sediments with other alpine depositional features results in storage and interseasonal release of groundwater that comprises up to 80% of the valley's streamflow during the driest months of the year. We summarize the emerging understanding of hydrogeologic processes in proglacial headwater systems of the region's principal river, the Rio Santa, and make suggestions for future research that will more clearly characterize the spatial distribution of stored groundwater within the mountain range. As glaciers continue to recede, differences in aquifer thickness and groundwater residence time between alpine catchments in the region will increasingly control dry season water availability at the local and basin scale.

Due to the shift of global market from conventional forest commodities and an ongoing increase in the demand for new advanced bioproducts, brand-new business models need to be developed and adopted to transform the forest sector. That is why researchers around the globe are much interested and invested in studying ways to optimize the interactions among different operations and entities working in this sector.

Decision trees and rule-based algorithms have demonstrated their potential to improve reliability of AIS classification because of their systematic approach and they have also been proposed in algorithms for selection of instrumentation levels in scoliosis. Our working hypothesis is that a rule-based algorithm with a knowledge base extracted from the literature can efficiently output surgical strategies alternatives for a given AIS case. Our objective is to develop a rule-based algorithm based on peer-reviewed literature to output alternative surgical strategies for approach and levels of fusion. A literature search of all English Manuscripts published between 2000 and December 2009 with Pubmed and Google scholar electronic search using the following keywords: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and surgery alternatively with levels of fusion or approach. All returned abstracts were screened for contents that could contain rules to include in the knowledge base. A dataset of 1,556 AIS cases treated surgically was used to test the surgical strategy rule-based algorithm (SSRBA) and evaluate how many surgical treatments are covered by the algorithm. The SSRBA was programmed using Matlab. Descriptive statistic was used to evaluate the ability of the rule-based algorithm to cover all treatment alternatives. A SSRBA was successfully developed following Lenke classification's concept that the spine is divided into three curve segments [proximal thoracic (PT), main thoracic (MT) and thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL)]. Each of the 1,556 AIS patients in the dataset was ran through the SSRBA. It proposed an average of 3.78 (+/- 2.06) surgical strategies per case. Overall, the SSRBA is able to match the treatment offered by the surgeon in approach and level of fusion 70 % of the time (with one vertebral level leeway). This study is to the author's knowledge the first attempt at proposing an algorithm to output all surgical alternatives for a given AIS case. It uses a rule-based algorithm with a knowledge base extracted from peer-reviewed literature in an area with great variability. When tested against a database of AIS patients treated surgically, the SSRBA developed has the ability to propose a surgical plan with respect to approach and levels of fusion that match the surgeon's plan in a great majority of cases. Since this SSRBA seems to output multiple valid surgical strategies, it could allow the comparisons of various strategies and the outcomes achieved in similar cases in large databases for a given case and guide surgical treatment.;\"[Phan, Philippe; Labelle, Hubert] St Justine Univ Hosp Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Phan, Philippe] Ottawa Civic Hosp, Div Orthoped, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada; [Ouellet, Jean] McGill Univ, Shriners Hosp Children, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mezghani, Neila; de Guise, Jacques A.] CHUM, Ctr Rech, Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Mezghani, Neila; de Guise, Jacques A.] CHUM, Ctr Rech, LIO, Montreal, PQ, Canada\";;Phan, P (corresponding author), Ottawa Civic Hosp, Div Orthoped, Civ Campus,1053 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada.;pphan@toh.on.ca;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2015;24;7;;;;;1370;1381;;10.1007/s00586-014-3736-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00586-014-3736-6;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000356875500005;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

However, for an industrial process to be optimized for intelligent manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0, it must be captured online using high-quality data. Laser welding of aluminum alloys presents a daunting challenge, mainly because aluminum is a less reliable material for welding than other commercial metals such as steel, primarily because of its physical properties: high thermal conductivity, high reflectivity, and low viscosity. The welding plates were fixed by a special welding fixture, to validate alignments and improve measurement accuracy, and a Computer-Aided Inspection (CAI) using 3D scanning was adopted. Certain literature has suggested real-time monitoring of intelligent techniques as a solution to the critical problems associated with aluminum laser welding. Real-time monitoring technologies are essential to improving welding efficiency and guaranteeing product quality. This paper critically reviews the research findings and advances for real-time monitoring of laser welding during the last 10 years. In the present work, a specific methodology originating from process monitoring using Computer-Aided Inspection in laser-welded blanks is reviewed as a candidate technology for a digital twin. Moreover, a novel digital model based on CAI and cloud manufacturing is proposed.;\"[Aminzadeh, Ahmad; Sattarpanah Karganroudi, Sasan] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Mathemat Informat & Genie, Rimouski, PQ G56 3A1, Canada; [Sattarpanah Karganroudi, Sasan] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Dept Mech Engn, Trois Rivieres, PQ G8Z 4M3, Canada; [Meiabadi, Mohammad Saleh] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Mech Engn, 1100 Notre Dame West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Mohan, Dhanesh G.] Shandong Univ, Inst Mat Joining, Jinan 250061, Peoples R China; [Ba, Kadiata] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Appl Sci Dept, 555 Boul Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada\";;\"Karganroudi, SS (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Dept Mathemat Informat & Genie, Rimouski, PQ G56 3A1, Canada.;Karganroudi, SS (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Dept Mech Engn, Trois Rivieres, PQ G8Z 4M3, Canada.\";\"ahmad.aminzadeh@uqar.ca; sattarpa@uqtr.ca; mohammadsaleh.sheikhmohammadmeiabadi.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; dhanesh@sdu.edu.cn; kadiata_ba@uqac.ca\";;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2022;6;2;;;;;;;19;10.3390/qubs6020019;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/qubs6020019;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000818281600001;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Early studies suffered methodological caveats leading to overoptimistic results and lack of statistical significance. The publication of guidelines addressing mainly the question of performance evaluation and statistical validation in seizure prediction helped revising the status of the field. While many studies failed to prove that above chance prediction is possible by applying these guidelines, other studies were successful. Methods based on EEG analysis using linear and nonlinear measures were reportedly successful in detecting preictal changes and using them to predict seizures above chance. In this review, we present a selection of studies in seizure prediction published in the last decade. The studies were selected based on the validity of the methods and the statistical significance of performance results. These results varied between studies and many showed acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity that could be appealing for therapeutic devices. The relatively large prediction horizon and early preictal changes reported in most studies suggest that seizure prediction may work better in closed loop seizure control devices rather than as seizure advisory devices. The emergence of a large database of annotated long-term EEG recordings should help prospective assessment of prediction methods. Some questions remain to be addressed before large clinical trials involving seizure prediction can be carried out. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although they were initially deployed for military purposes, they now have a wide array of applications in various public and private sectors. Further deployment of drones can promote the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though drones offer a number of advantages, they have limited flying time and weight carrying capacity. Effective drone schedules may assist with overcoming such limitations. Drone scheduling is associated with optimization of drone flight paths and may include other features, such as determination of arrival time at each node, utilization of drones, battery capacity considerations, and battery recharging considerations. A number of studies on drone scheduling have been published over the past years. However, there is a lack of a systematic literature survey that provides a holistic overview of the drone scheduling problem, existing tendencies, main research limitations, and future research needs. Therefore, this study conducts an extensive survey of the scientific literature that assessed drone scheduling. The collected studies are grouped into different categories, including general drone scheduling, drone scheduling for delivery of goods, drone scheduling for monitoring, and drone scheduling with recharge considerations. A detailed review of the collected studies is presented for each of the categories. Representative mathematical models are provided for each category of studies, accompanied by a summary of findings, existing gaps in the state-of-the-art, and future research needs.

The aim of this review was to summarize the existing knowledge on the following: (a) work disability risk factors; (b) reliable and valid work disability assessment tools; and (c) efficient interventions to reduce work disability in individuals with knee OA. An electronic document search using key words and MeSH terms was performed with various databases. Two independent investigators were tasked with the screening of articles and quality assessment. A critical appraisal of what is known was performed and recommendations for clinical practice and future research were formulated. The database search yielded 61 references. One article on risk factors, three related to assessment tools, and two on interventions were retained. Age and previous work absence episodes were found to be risk factors of workplace disability. The Work Limitation Questionnaire, the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the Workplace Activity Limitations Scale were psychometrically sound for the population studied. Education-based interventions seem to be more effective than conventional interventions in helping individuals with knee OA return to work faster, reduce the number of days absent from work, and improve their overall well-being. This review is the first to summarize the evidence on work disability risk factors, assessment tools, and interventions for this growing population and to show a critical gap in the existing knowledge.

However, in the last few years, questions have been raised regarding the potential toxicity of CNTs to humans and the environment; it is believed that the physiochemical characteristics of these materials are key determinants of CNT interaction with living cells and hence determine their toxicity in humans and other organisms as well as their embryos. Thus, several recent studies, including ours, pointed out that CNTs have cytotoxic effects on human and animal cells, which occur via the alteration of key regulator genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival, cell-cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. Meanwhile, few investigations revealed that CNTs could also be harmful to the normal development of the embryo.

Disregarding such temporal considerations has previously been underlined as an important source of uncertainty, but a growing number of approaches have been developed to tackle this issue. Nevertheless, their adoption by LCA practitioners is still uncommon, which raises concerns about the representativeness of current LCA results. Furthermore, a lack of consistency can be observed in the used terms for discussions on temporal considerations. The purpose of this review is thus to search for common ground and to identify the current implementation challenges while also proposing development pathways. This paper introduces a glossary of the most frequently used terms related to temporal considerations in LCA to build a common understanding of key concepts and to facilitate discussions. A review is also performed on current solutions for temporal considerations in different LCA phases (goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis and life cycle impact assessment), analysing each temporal consideration for its relevant conceptual developments in LCA and its level of operationalisation. We then present a potential stepwise approach and development pathways to address the current challenges of implementation for dynamic LCA (DLCA). Three key focal areas for integrating temporal considerations within the LCA framework are discussed: i) define the temporal scope over which temporal distributions of emissions occurring, ii) use calendar-specific information to model systems and associated impacts, and select the appropriate level of temporal resolution to describe the variations of flows and characterisation factors. Addressing more temporal considerations within a DLCA framework is expected to reduce uncertainties and increase the representativeness of results, but possible trade-offs between additional data collection efforts and the increased value of results from DLCAs should be kept in mind.

The direction combustion model, the solid waste incinerator caustic soda oxides of carbon entrapment model (SWI-NaOH-OCEM) developed by this research has achieved a zero carbon release. This research adopted the literature search method to put together research results of previous works relevant to the aim of this present work. It has been shown that CO and CO2 emissions can be contained during the derivation of alternative or supplementary cementing materials used in the replacement of ordinary Portland cement in civil engineering works. In the overall assessment of the present review work has left the environment free of the hazards of CO and CO2 emissions. It was shown that these supplementary cementing materials derived from solid wastes improve the engineering properties of treated soft clay and expansive soils, concrete, and asphalt. Bio-peels, another form solid waste has been established as a good detoxificant used in treating wastewater. It has been shown that solid waste recycling and reuse is a hub to achieving ecofriendly, ecoefficient and sustainable infrastructural development on the global scale.;\"[Onyelowe, Kennedy Chibuzor; Ubachukwu, Obiekwe; Alaneme, George; Ugwuanyi, Henry; Ugorji, Benjamin] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Civil Engn, PMB 7267, Umuahia 440109, Abia State, Nigeria; [Onyelowe, Kennedy Chibuzor; Ubachukwu, Obiekwe; Alaneme, George; Ugwuanyi, Henry; Ugorji, Benjamin] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Construct Mat & Sustainabil, Res Grp Geotech Engn, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Duc Bui Van; Manh Nguyen Van; Thinh Ta Duc; Tho Pham Duc] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Fac Civil Engn, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Duc Bui Van; Manh Nguyen Van; Thinh Ta Duc; Tho Pham Duc] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Res Grp Geotech Engn Construct Mat & Sustainabil, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ezugwu, Charles; Ikpa, Chidozie] Alex Ekwueme Fed Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Ndufu Alike Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Salahudeen, Bunyamin] Univ Jos, Dept Civil Engn, Jos, Nigeria; [Ikeagwuani, Chijioke] Univ Nigeria, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Amhadi, Talal] Univ Quebec, Dept Construct & Civil Engn, ETS, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sosa, Felix] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Civil Engn, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Wu, Wei] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Prof Dr Head Inst Geotech Engn, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Eberemu, Adrian] Ahmadu Bello Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Zaria, Kaduna, Nigeria; [Barah, Obinna] Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Awka, Nigeria; [Orji, Francis] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Agr & Bioresources Engn, PMB 7267, Umuahia 440109, Abia State, Nigeria; [Amanamba, Ezenwa] Gregory Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Okigwe, Nigeria; [Sai, Vishnu] PVS Structech, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Kadurumba, Chukwuma] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Mech Engn, Umudike, Nigeria; [Subburaj, Selvakumar] Bannari Amman Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Sathyamangalam 638401, India\";;\"Onyelowe, KC (corresponding author), Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Civil Engn, PMB 7267, Umuahia 440109, Abia State, Nigeria.;Onyelowe, KC (corresponding author), Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Construct Mat & Sustainabil, Res Grp Geotech Engn, Hanoi, Vietnam.\";konyelowe@mouau.edu.ng;;;;;;;;26;26;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2019;14;3;;;;;440;451;;10.1093/ijlct/ctz028;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijlct/ctz028;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000493305600016;View Full Record in Web of Science\n",

Q.\";;Mt Res Initiative EDW Working Grp;Elevation-dependent warming in mountain regions of the world;NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE;;;;Review;;;;;;;;\"There is growing evidence that the rate of warming is amplified with elevation, such that high-mountain environments experience more rapid changes in temperature than environments at lower elevations. Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations.\";\"[Pepin, N.] Univ Portsmouth, Dept Geog, Portsmouth PO1 3HE, Hants, England; [Bradley, R.
