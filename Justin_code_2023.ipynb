This is due to several reasons, the most important of which is issues with productivity (Changali et al. The Construction Productivity Imperative, p 10, 2015, [1]). Off-site manufacturing in construction is one solution to increase productivity, but there is a current lack of studies linking it to the concept of design for manufacturing and assembly (Jin et al. J Cleaner Prod 202:1202–1219, 2018, [3]). Building information modeling (BIM) also offers new opportunities to underpin the computerized design and fabrication of industrialized buildings, providing greater productivity and cost-effectiveness (He et al. J. Cleaner Prod 278:123505, 2021, [18]). The combination of BIM and off-site construction (OSC) could maximize their benefits to the construction industry and their applications are highly recommended to improve construction efficiency (Yin et al. Autom Constr 101:72–91, 2019, [7]). However, even if the relationship between BIM and off-site construction has been identified and discussed among pioneer researchers, gaps were found in the literature concerning the integration of BIM and digital fabrication with off-site manufacturing (OSM) in construction. There has been insufficient research in integrating these practices. The aim of this literature review is to assess the current state of the combined use of digital fabrication, BIM, and OSM in the context of Construction 4.0. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to study the relationship between these practices. The contribution to the body of knowledge will be the outcome of this literature review including an in-depth discussion on main trends in off-site construction, research gaps, and recommendations for near-future perspectives in off-site construction. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.', \"Automotive industry; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Fabrication; Industrial research; Productivity; Structural design; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Digital fabrication; Literature reviews; Mega projects; Off-site construction; Off-site manufacturing; Roadmap; Scientific literature; Systematic literature review; Architectural design\", 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132046180&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-0968-9_23&partnerID=40&md5=4293f1714b1c8bb51faa30cf37498f34', ['literature review', 5, 'review match']]\n",

Successful implementation of BIM is helping the industry move from traditional project delivery systems to integrated ones. This transition, however, requires reliable and concrete contractual mechanisms to provide guidance and structure. Risk allocation, role definition, and legal dimensions have been achieved through a series of contractual functions such as control, coordination, and contingency. While past scientific publications have investigated the impact of contracts on BIM and vice-versa, questions remain as to how these realization mechanisms interact with BIM requirements and legal issues. This study aimed at understanding the influence of contractual language and legal aspects on BIM-enabled projects. To do so, an in-depth literature review was performed in multiple rounds. Problematic issues in contracts were identified, including contractual complexity, emphasis on controlling provisions, contract incompleteness and missing or unclear legal clauses. Then a coding system was created based on the legal factors identified. The results indicate that current standardized contracts in Canada are incomplete and ill-adapted to support effective BIM implementation. The key elements such as intellectual property, ownership of data, responsibilities regarding the production and control of critical project data and asset information are underrated or overlooked. While efforts have been made to counter this (e.g., IBC BIM contract appendix and BIM Execution Plans), these efforts remain fragmented and bespoke for the most part, which introduces variability in the contracting process and therefore impacts the BIM implementation process at the project level. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.', \"Project management; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Communication and collaborations; Contract document; Contract provisions; Gap analysis; Information collaborations; Information communication; Information flows; Model implementation; Architectural design\", 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132026504&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-1029-6_21&partnerID=40&md5=32422ef8c51c622aa4d3771e990ac4f1', ['literature review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

Poorly defined project may lead in these cases to injuries and difficulties to perform tasks. Participative approaches such as Lean-led design—in which stakeholders such as the clinicians and the patient are involved during the whole process of project definition—are proposed to address this problem. However, little is said in the literature, regarding the value of this approach to deliver projects that are better aligned with hospital client needs. This paper provides, firstly, based on a scoping review, a better comprehension concerning the implementation of Lean-led Design that is used to generate a synthesis of the literature around the subject. Secondly, it presents the preliminary results of the implementation of Lean-led Design approach during the project definition of a mega hospital in Canada. This approach was adopted in order to ensure the harmonization of needs and requirements stemming form the fusion of two hospitals in this complex.

Many challenges remain however, in its conceptualization, particularly in terms of identifying and understanding its components and how they are articulated. While innovation in the construction industry has led to new perspectives on how the industry designs, delivers and maintains the built environment, its implementation remains a considerable challenge for industry stakeholders. To reap its oft-promised benefits, companies need to identify and evaluate innovations that can be effectively deployed on their projects while understanding the scale and scope of their impact. As such, providing ways to fully understand the types of innovations and, potentially, their impact can help in guiding their implementation. The objective of the research presented in this paper was to develop a classification system for innovation in construction and to identify the characteristics of its different facets. Departing from the more traditional hierarchical view of innovation classification, a flatter, multi-facetted approach to classification is proposed. This approach is believed to be more representative of the multiple perspectives adopted in the literature to report these characteristics. The choice of class was dictated by its ease of application to industry and the complementary nature of the different facets. The classification of innovations focuses on 5 dimensions adapted from the literature review and chosen based on their applicability, which was tested through a survey. The classified objects can correspond to several facets and elements thanks to the faceted structure, making the classification more modular and expandable. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.', 'Construction; Built environment; Classification system; Conceptual frameworks; Faceted Classification; Industry designs; Industry stakeholders; Process impact; Process mechanisms; Scale and scope; Types of innovations; Construction industry', 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132011777&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-0968-9_2&partnerID=40&md5=7b0e64884c12bb6eafd78f750e37a60d', ['literature review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

BIM and 3DCP are evolving in parallel, though, and the potential for their integrated use or convergence has not yet been sufficiently studied.

Considering that the risks related to energy sources during the operation stage of industrial facilities can be major, our objective is to propose a PtD approach for this type of risk that uses AMC tools. For this purpose, our methodology is based on the information systems design-science paradigm. Considering that both BIM and PLM mock-ups can be used to design industrial facilities and that Catia V5 is one of the main software programs used to design industrial equipment and facilities, our methodology specifically includes a comparative literature review of the uses of AMC tools to check BIM and PLM mock-ups and a comparative study of the OHS risk prevention capabilities of the AMC tools available in Catia V5. Therefore, the PtD approach that we propose is specific to Catia V5. It consists of: 1) extracting rules related to hazardous energy control from regulatory requirements and classifying them according to their automation potential, 2) expressing the rules in a form that is compatible with the RASE method, 3) interpreting the rules using the RASE method, and 4) using a macro script to automatically check the compliance of the digital mock-ups. The proposed approach's contribution is that it makes it possible to support facility designers in automatically identifying hazardous energy sources in systems.

Over recent years, increasingly complex approaches based on sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network architectures have been pushing performance on well-established benchmark datasets. In this paper, we take a step back and analyze the real need of such complexity. We first compile and review the performance of 20 different techniques on some popular databases, and we demonstrate that a minimalistic version of a standard U-Net with several orders of magnitude less parameters, carefully trained and rigorously evaluated, closely approximates the performance of current best techniques. We then show that a cascaded extension (W-Net) reaches outstanding performance on several popular datasets, still using orders of magnitude less learnable weights than any previously published work. Furthermore, we provide the most comprehensive cross-dataset performance analysis to date, involving up to 10 different databases. Our analysis demonstrates that the retinal vessel segmentation is far from solved when considering test images that differ substantially from the training data, and that this task represents an ideal scenario for the exploration of domain adaptation techniques. In this context, we experiment with a simple self-labeling strategy that enables moderate enhancement of cross-dataset performance, indicating that there is still much room for improvement in this area. Finally, we test our approach on Artery/Vein and vessel segmentation from OCTA imaging problems, where we again achieve results well-aligned with the state-of-the-art, at a fraction of the model complexity available in recent literature.

The current paper reviews the conventional pyrometallurgical processes and technologies that have been practiced for the treatment of antimony concentrates. The blast furnace is the most commonly used technology, mainly because of its adaptability to different feeds and grades and a high recovery rate. In addition, several other more environmentally friendly pyrometallurgical routes, that were recently developed, are reviewed but these are still at laboratory- or pilot-scales.

Currently, the use of UAVs for medical goods transportation is restricted to a few areas spread all over the world. However, UAVs have been gaining popularity since they became cheap, reliable, and able to overcome geographical and economical challenges, related to poor infrastructure or remote areas. Depending on the intensity and amplitude of the vibration at which a UAV is subjected to, several complications can arise, such as decrease in equipment reliability, reduction of fatigue life, inaccurate information from measurement tools, and a decrease in the quality of the transported load. This article presents a literature review on the use of UAVs for medical transportation, by focusing on the evaluation of the vibration impact on medical product integrity. In order to understand the vibration characteristics caused by rotational components, maneuvers and environmental disturbances, some flights were performed with a quadcopter carrying a payload using different attachment configurations. The vibration levels of the aerial vehicle and its payload were assessed and a significant amplification of the vibration levels of the UAV payload was found for all configurations, indicating the importance of the correct attachment design for medical transportation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.', 'Antennas; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vibrations (mechanical); Aerial vehicle; Medical product transportation; Medical products; Payload integrity; Product transportation; Time varying; Time-varying acceleration; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vibration effect; Vibration level; Flight dynamics', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134424639&doi=10.1007%2fs40430-022-03644-2&partnerID=40&md5=502547666a9d479bc856331fbee58387', ['literature review', 1, 'overview', 2, 'review match']]\n",

Indeed, mobile apps undergo frequent updates to introduce new features, fix reported issues or adapt to new technological or environment changes. Hence, introducing changes in this context is risky and can harmfully impact the application rating and competitiveness. Thus, ensuring that the application updates are deployed in a controlled way is of crucial importance. To better support mobile applications evolution and cut-off the costs of users dissatisfaction, we propose in this paper, AppTracker, a novel approach to automatically track bad release updates in Android applications (i.e., releases with higher percentage of negative reviews relative to the prior releases). We formulate the problem as a three-class classification problem to label the apps updates as bad, neutral or good. To solve this problem, we evolve bad release detection rules using Multi-Objective Genetic Programming (MOGP) based on the adaptation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). In particular, the search process aims to provide the optimal trade-off between two conflicting objectives to deal with the considered classes. We evaluate our approach and investigate the performance of both within-project and cross-project validation scenarios on a benchmark of 50,700 updates from 1,717 free Android apps from Google Play Store. The statistical tests revealed that our approach achieves a clear advantage over machine learning approaches (e.g., random forest, decision tree, etc.) with significant improvements of 18% and 6% in terms of F1-score within-project and cross-project validations, respectively.

These characteristics make laser welding a superior process. Many industries are aware of the benefits of switching to lasers. For example, metal-joining is migrating to modern industrial laser technology due to improved yields, design flexibility, and energy efficiency. However, for an industrial process to be optimized for intelligent manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0, it must be captured online using high-quality data. Laser welding of aluminum alloys presents a daunting challenge, mainly because aluminum is a less reliable material for welding than other commercial metals such as steel, primarily because of its physical properties: high thermal conductivity, high reflectivity, and low viscosity. The welding plates were fixed by a special welding fixture, to validate alignments and improve measurement accuracy, and a Computer-Aided Inspection (CAI) using 3D scanning was adopted. Certain literature has suggested real-time monitoring of intelligent techniques as a solution to the critical problems associated with aluminum laser welding. Real-time monitoring technologies are essential to improving welding efficiency and guaranteeing product quality. This paper critically reviews the research findings and advances for real-time monitoring of laser welding during the last 10 years. In the present work, a specific methodology originating from process monitoring using Computer-Aided Inspection in laser-welded blanks is reviewed as a candidate technology for a digital twin.

These AAEMs greatly affect the thermal conversion of biomass, although their effects are only partly understood. Furthermore, while coal currently plays a major role in global energy demand, its massive use in a carbon-constrained world has prompted the need to identify alternative and carbon-neutral energy sources. In this context, the co-pyrolysis of biomass with coal has been shown to be a promising way to support the transition from fossil to renewable energy carriers. Because AAEMs can significantly impact such a co-processing approach, there is therefore the need for a firm understanding of their catalytic role. Consequently, and to examine and summarize the main research advances that have been made in this field, the present review first covers a description of the main properties of lignocellulosic biomass and coal, along with their decomposition processes. It then focuses on AAEM catalysts and on their impact on pyrolysis reaction pathways and kinetics. In terms of highlights, the review illustrates that the presence of inherent or impregnated AAEMs shifts the decomposition of biomass to lower temperatures while increasing the char and gas yields at the expense of bio-oil. Moreover, these effects depend significantly on the nature of the catalyst considered and on the way it is mixed with biomass. As examples, potassium tends to favor the production of low molecular weight compounds and gaseous species, magnesium promotes dehydration reactions, whereas calcium and magnesium oxides allow to upgrade volatiles by deoxygenation and deacidification. A discussion of pyrolysis reaction mechanisms is also proposed by reviewing the different pathways involved in the decomposition of the main components of biomass and coal, noting that the emphasis is particularly on the changes induced by AAEM catalysts. The synergistic effects between coal and biomass which are likely to enhance the co-pyrolysis process are then discussed. Eventually, a comprehensive reaction pathway is proposed to better explain the important role played by AAEM catalysts during primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions. © 2022 The Authors', 'Activation energy; Alkaline earth metals; Alkalinity; Biomass; Carbon; Catalysts; Dehydration; Magnesia; Potassium; Pyrolysis; Reaction kinetics; Sodium; Alkali earth metal; Alkaline-earth metals; Calcium and magnesiums; Catalytic effects; Catalytic pyrolysis; Copyrolysis; Metal catalyst; Pyrolysis process; Pyrolysis reaction; Reaction pathways; Coal', 'Review', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125806509&doi=10.1016%2fj.jaap.2022.105479&partnerID=40&md5=9ef05f6be247d417ad359a1814789e01', ['review match']]\n",

Just like any other software, these frameworks regularly encounter errors. These errors are reported by app developers in the form of bug reports. These bug reports related to accessibility faults need to be urgently fixed since their existence significantly hinders the usability of apps. In this context, the manual inspection of a large number of bug reports to identify accessibility-related ones is time-consuming and error-prone. Prior research has investigated mobile app user reviews classification for various purposes, including bug reports identification, feature request identification, app performance optimization etc. Yet, none of the prior research has investigated the identification of accessibility-related bug reports, making their prioritization and timely correction difficult for software developers. To support developers with this manual process, the goal of this paper is to automatically detect, for a given bug report, whether it is about accessibility or not. Thus, we tackle the identification of accessibility bug reports as a binary classification problem.

Davenport Wind Loading Chain), the review also extends to cover wind damage assessment and wind-related hazard mitigation and response (considering emerging performance-based and resilience-based wind design methodologies). This state-of-the-art review suggests to what extend ML has been utilized in each of these topic areas within wind engineering and provides a comprehensive summary to improve understanding how learning algorithms work and when these schemes succeed or fail. Moreover, critical challenges and prospects of ML applications in wind engineering are identified to facilitate future research efforts.

In Canada, the federal, provincial and municipal governments (as well as other regional and local entities) share responsibilities for regulating noise from different sources, like transportation, leisure, industry or construction. The present review covers policies and regulations developed since the 1970s by different levels of government and shows a fragmented and uneven portrait that varies by provinces, as well as a multiplicity of stakeholders and measures that should be better integrated and harmonized. The current approach to noise, often focused on a posteriori redress and on controlling noise levels, is insufficient to address the wide variety of noise issues. We argue that it could be widened and enriched by (i) a qualitative analysis of the various sensibilities of different people to types of noise and their context, and (ii) planning tools that would integrate sound considerations in the early stages of land development and management practices. Thus improved, noise regulations would better equip different Canadian governmental actors to respond to the high economic and social costs of this environmental pollutant and to the desire to reduce inequalities in population noise exposures. © Canadian Public Policy / Analyse de politiques.', 'environmental justice; environmental policy; noise pollution; pollution control; stakeholder; Canada', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128751230&doi=10.3138%2fcpp.2021-009&partnerID=40&md5=a415d9b0f77b20ec29bb759eb79a8651', ['review match']]\n",

Scientific knowledge of the effects of CDMs contributes to the reduction in inherent uncertainties and facil-itates the decision-making and design processes. The goal of this article is to present an algorithm designed to evaluate and hierarchize CDMs in relation to different coastal environments. Drawn from 411 published scientific case studies, a total of 1709 authors’ observation statements regarding the effects of CDMs on the study sites’ environmental features (type of coast, type of substrate, tidal range, and wave climate) were entered in a database, categorized, and weighted according to a qualitative scale. The algorithm processes the information by establishing a correspondence between user-se-lected environment features and those stocked in the database, and it evaluates user-selected CDMs in relation to the specified coastal characteristics by identifying, collating, and rating the effects as observed in similar contexts. The result is a tool able to process, structure, and concretize scientific knowledge regarding CDMs and their effects on coastal systems. It is complementary to existing tools currently used in the decision-making and design processes of the CDMs. The results present the hi-erarchization of CDMs according to a multilevel aggregated structure, which can be used in different ways by coastal managers, decision-makers, and engineers. The algorithm, based on standardized coastal characteristics, can be applied to any shoreline worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

The literature review has surveyed many algorithm simulations for optimizing geolocation and target-tracking estimation. Although most of these algorithms have their own advantages, they have weaknesses, such as accuracy, mathematical complexity, difficulties in implementation, and validation in the real environment, etc. This study has been concerned with investigating the accuracy of geolocation and tracking under high speed and powerful rotation using extracted data from the Orolia Skydel simulator, which simulates the space environment involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites as sensors and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as RFI emitters. Various scenarios modeled using the Orolia Simulator for quasi-real dynamic trajectories of LEO satellites have been created. The assumed approaches have been verified by Cramer–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and Posterior CRLB (PCRLB) to determine the increase in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value.

Unfortunately the second way suffers from many challenges and limitations. Occupant behavior is, indeed, a complex and multi-disciplinary concept depending on several human factors. Although its importance is recognized by the energy management community, it is often oversimplified and naively defined when used to study, analyze or model energy load. This paper aims at promoting the definition of occupant behavior as well as exploring the extent to which the latter is involved in research works, targeting directly or indirectly energy savings. Hence, in this work, we propose an overview of interdisciplinary research approaches that consider occupants’ energy-saving behaviors, while we present the big picture and evaluate how occupant behavior is defined, we also propose a categorization of the major works that consider energy-consuming occupant behavior. Our findings via a literature review methodology, based on a bibliometric study, reveal a growth of the number of research works involving occupant behavior to model load forecasting and household segmentation.

Implementing solar technologies in a greenhouse application would help to enhance its performance sustainably. This study presents a survey and evaluation of photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal collectors (STC), and photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) solar technologies for greenhouses. PV modules show promising results to cover the electrical energy demands and ensure adequate crop production. However, the main issue with static conventional PV solar modules is the shading effect that causes a reduction in the photosynthetic efficiency of greenhouse crops. It was found that 1% of fixed module coverage decreases a tomato crop's yield by about 0.66%. The literature shows two potential solutions for this: dynamic shading and concentrating solar technologies. The review also revealed that the integration of semi-transparent PV solar technologies is a possible prospect for greenhouses. Furthermore, the review identified STC collectors, with and without concentration and storage technologies, to heat the greenhouse's interior and decrease fossil fuel needs. Whereas the hybrid PV/T were analyzed for greenhouse application, it was found that PV/T modules are gaining interest due to their high efficiency and generation of electrical and thermal energy from a single panel. Finally, it was concluded that by employing these solar technologies in greenhouses, crop yield and quality could be enhanced while ensuring sustainable and environmentally friendly energy production.

However, conceptual studies on integration in IPD literature are scattered and fragmented, that is, most of the studies only focused on the segmented dimension of integration. A systemic understanding of the concepts of integration in IPD project-based context is still lacking. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes two aspects of integration (dimensions and directions) in IPD literature and explores their extent in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded theory review and focus group discussion approaches were employed to perform a thorough conceptual review of the literature, frame the research into the theory and increase the fundamental understanding of the concept of integration in IPD literature. Findings: In this study, IPD integrating techniques were identified and their integration dimensions and directions were discussed. Results show that integration in the project-based environment of IPD is a multidimensional construct. Based on organizational, contractual and operational characteristics of IPD projects, twenty-four integration mechanisms were identified and framed into seven clusters. The integration directions over project life-cycle were demonstrated in three contexts: (1) an on-site construction project, delivered traditionally, (2) an on-site construction project, delivered with IPD and (3) an off-site construction project, delivered with IPD. Originality/value: This paper gathers the segments of integration into a comprehensive overview, which can help researchers and practitioners explore elements of IPD project success more precisely. A theoretical framework of integration clusters is developed, based on IPD literature. The impact of IPD on on-site versus off-site construction is illustrated from an integration direction perspective. Finally, future areas of studies for researchers and practitioners about the concept of integration in an IPD context are discussed.

Drone scheduling is associated with optimization of drone flight paths and may include other features, such as determination of arrival time at each node, utilization of drones, battery capacity considerations, and battery recharging considerations. A number of studies on drone scheduling have been published over the past years. However, there is a lack of a systematic literature survey that provides a holistic overview of the drone scheduling problem, existing tendencies, main research limitations, and future research needs. Therefore, this study conducts an extensive survey of the scientific literature that assessed drone scheduling.

This moti-vates the scientific community to develop efficient transformation and linearization approaches for the optimization models that have non-linear terms. Such transformations and linearizations are expected to decrease the computational complexity of the original non-linear optimization models and, ultimately, facilitate decision making. This study provides a detailed state-of-the-art review focusing on the existing transformation and linearization techniques that have been used for solving optimization models with non-linear terms within the objective functions and/or constraint sets. The existing transformation approaches are analyzed for a wide range of scenarios (multiplication of binary variables, multiplication of binary and continuous variables, multiplication of continuous variables, maximum/minimum operators, absolute value function, floor and ceiling functions, square root function, and multiple breakpoint function). Furthermore, a detailed review of piecewise approximating functions and log-linearization via Taylor series approximation is presented. Along with a review of the existing methods, this study proposes a new technique for linearizing the square root terms by means of transformation.

Liquid water appears the most detrimental of all environmental agents, not only because it can significantly reduce capillary cohesion inside the material but also because water can penetrate inside buildings through multiple routes, e.g. rainfall, foundation rise, ambient humidity and utilities leakage. Water can also be very damaging when it is present in solid form as the expansion of pore ice may induce cracking of the earth material. The high resistance of earth buildings to wind is instead proven by the good conditions of many historic structures in windy regions. Earth buildings also exhibit good resistance to fire as the exposure to very high temperatures may even improve material durability. Solar radiation has, in general, a beneficial effect on the stability of earth buildings as it promotes water evaporation with a consequent increase of capillary cohesion. Solar radiation may, however, have a detrimental effect if the earth is stabilised by organic binders that are sensitive to photodegradation because, in this case, it may produce material damages ranging from a simple surface discoloration to a much more serious deterioration\\xa0of the intergranular bonds. Unstabilized earth is generally inert and, hence, largely unaffected by chemicals though, in some instances, the precipitation of salt crystals inside the pore water can induce material cracking. Chemical degradation can instead be severe in both stabilised earth (due to the dissolution of intergranular bonds) and steel-reinforced earth (due to the corrosion of rebars). No international standard protocol exists to measure the durability of earth materials, which is currently assessed by multiple experimental procedures depending on which environmental agent is considered. Testing standards may, however, be devised in the future by differentiating between weathering protocols, which reproduce the effect of each agent on the earth\\xa0sample, and durability protocols, which adopt a unique\\xa0experimental procedure to measure a given\\xa0material property regardless of weathering history. © 2022, RILEM.', '', 'Book Chapter', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120607069&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-83297-1_6&partnerID=40&md5=52949b28c52015e2d9a6eb28b2dbfeb2', ['review match']]\n",

Objective: We aim to develop a broader understanding of the impact of refactoring activities on Android and traditional code smells in Android apps. Method: We conduct a longitudinal empirical study by analyzing the evolution history of five open-source Android apps comprising 652 releases and exhibiting a total of 9,600 refactoring operations. We consider 15 common Android smell types and 10 common traditional Object-Oriented (OO) code smell types to provide a broad overview of the relationship between refactoring and code smells. Results: We find that code smells are widespread across Android applications, but smelly classes are not particularly targeted by refactoring activities and, when they are, it is rare for refactoring to actually remove a smell.

This paper proposes checsdm, a systematic approach, based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), for assisting engineering teams in ensuring consistency of heterogeneous design of safety-critical systems. The approach is developed as a generic methodology and a tool framework, that can be applied to various design scenarios involving different modelling languages and different design guidelines. The methodology comprises an iterative three-phased process. The first phase, elicitation, aims at specifying requirements of the heterogeneous design scenario. Using the proposed tool framework, the second phase, codification, consists in building a particular tool set that supports the heterogeneous design scenario and helps engineers in flagging consistency errors for review and eventual correction. The third phase, operation, applies the tool set to actual system designs. Empirical evaluation of the work is presented through two executions of the checsdm approach for the specific cases of a design scenario involving a mix of UML, Simulink and Stateflow, and a design scenario involving a mix of AADL, Simulink and Stateflow. The operation phase of the first case was performed over three avionics systems and the identified inconsistencies in the design models of these systems were compared to the results of a fully manual verification carried out by professional engineers. The evaluation also includes an assessment workshop with industrial practitioners to examine their perceptions about the approach. The empirical validation indicates the feasibility and 'cost-effectiveness' of the approach. Inconsistencies were identified in the three avionics systems with a greater recall rate over the manual verification. The assessment workshop shows the practitioners found the approach easy to understand and gave an overall likelihood of adoption within the context of their work. © 1976-2012 IEEE.\", 'Avionics; Cost effectiveness; Iterative methods; Modeling languages; Safety engineering; Security systems; Systems analysis; Avionic systems; Consistency; Design guideline; DO-178c; Heterogeneous design; Model-driven Engineering; Safety critical system design; Safety critical systems; SIMULINK and STATEFLOW; Toolsets; Design', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096781663&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2020.2966994&partnerID=40&md5=e3b30f917abafe2ac311659f8fa568cc', ['review match']]\n",

Methods and analysis PROMPT-SCI (protocol for rapid onset of mobilisation in patients with traumatic SCI) is a single-site single-arm proof-of-concept trial. Forty-five patients aged 18 years or older with a severe traumatic SCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A, B or C) from C0 to L2 undergoing spinal surgery within 48 hours of the injury will be included. Participants will receive daily 30 min continuous sessions of in-bed leg cycling for 14 consecutive days, initiated within 48 hours of the end of spinal surgery. The feasibility outcomes are: (1) absence of serious adverse events associated with cycling, (2) completion of 1 full session within 48 hours of spinal surgery for 90% of participants and (3) completion of 11 sessions for 80% of participants. Patient outcomes 6 weeks and 6 months after the injury will be measured using neurofunctional assessments, quality of life questionnaires and inpatient length of stay. Feasibility and patient outcomes will be analysed with descriptive statistics. Patient outcomes will also be compared with a matched historical cohort that has not undergone in-bed cycling using McNemar and Student's t-tests for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively.

In this review, we summarized and discussed the radiomic techniques used for ASD analysis. Currently, the limited radiomic work of ASD is related to the variation of morphological features of brain thickness that is different from texture analysis. These techniques are based on imaging shape features that can be used with predictive models for predicting ASD. This review explores the progress of ASD-based radiomics with a brief description of ASD and the current non-invasive technique used to classify between ASD and healthy control (HC) subjects. With AI, new radiomic models using the deep learning techniques will be also described.

Among them, cement-bitumen treated materials (CBTM) are often employed because of both contributions given by bitumen (in form of emulsion) and cement. The first confers a bituminous behaviour, whereas the second ensures good short-term performance otherwise penalized by the presence of water. Water plays a fundamental role in providing workability of the mixture at the atmospheric production temperatures. Due to such peculiarities, CBTM mixtures require attention when rheological modelling is performed in the small strain domain. This paper provides an overview on the most common rheological model applied to bituminous mixtures (2S2P1D) and the main issues related to the application to CBTM mixtures are highlighted. Afterwards, another model is proposed from the literature, the DBN model, and applied to three mixtures. The mixtures were prepared to assess the effect of the bitumen emulsion used, as well as the type of curing conditions.

This increasing trend in extreme rainfall is seen in both the observational record and climate model projections. However, a thorough review of the recent scientific literature paints a complex picture in which the intensification of rainfall extremes depends on a multitude of factors. While some projected rainfall indices follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship scaling of an ∼7% increase in rainfall per 1°C of warming, there is substantial evidence that this scaling depends on rainfall extremes frequency, with longer return period events seeing larger increases, leading to super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in some cases. The intensification of extreme rainfall events is now well documented at the daily scale but is less clear at the subdaily scale. In recent years, climate model simulations at a finer spatial and temporal resolution, including convection-permitting models, have provided more reliable projections of subdaily rainfall. Recent analyses indicate that rainfall scaling may also increase as a function of duration, such that shorter-duration, longer return period events will likely see the largest rainfall increases in a warmer climate. This has broad implications on the design and the use of rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, for which both an overall increase in magnitude and a steepening can now be predicted. This paper also presents an overview of measures that have been adopted by various governing bodies to adapt IDF curves to the changing climate. Current measures vary from multiplying historical design rainfall by a simple constant percentage to modulating correction factors based on return periods and to scaling them to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship based on projected temperature increases. All of these current measures fail to recognize a possible super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall and, perhaps more importantly, the increasing scaling toward shorter-duration rainfall and the most extreme rainfall events that will significantly impact stormwater runoff in cities and in small rural catchments.

The building roofs are the main sources of undesirable heat for buildings, especially in warm climates. This paper discusses the use and application of white roofing material in emerging economies. The use of white roofing material is a suggestion because of its cooling, evaporative and efficiency characteristics compared to traditional black roofing materials. Many research studies have shown that the darker roofing surfaces that are prevalent in many urban areas actually can increase temperature by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius to the environment surrounding these urban areas. Additionally, improved temperature control and heat reflection also work to reduce the energy requirements for the interior spaces of the structures that have white roofing surfaces. The white or lighter colored roofs tend to reflect a part of the solar radiation that strikes the roof’s surface. Consequently, one might believe that white roofing material would be commonplace and especially so within emerging economies. Yet, this is hardly the case at all. This paper examines the issue of white roofing materials in emerging economies from a dual perspective. The dual perspective includes the technical details of white roofing material and its impact on lowering the interior temperature of the affected structures, which consequently reduces hours of indoor thermal discomfort and use of air conditioners in indoor spaces. The other element in this study, however, involves the marketing aspect of white roofing material.

The matter requires finding a radical and effective solution to overcome this problem. The methods used for overcoming the RFI include interference detection, interference classification, interference geolocation, tracking and interference mitigation. RFI source geolocation and tracking methodology gained universal attention from numerous researchers, specialists, and scientists.

SA is defined as the perception of elements in an environment (level 1), understanding their meaning (level 2), and the projection of their state into the future (level 3). The first step to assess SA is identifying its requirements, for which goal-directed task analysis (GDTA) is the recommended technique. GDTA is a type of cognitive task analysis that focuses on the goals that a human operator must achieve, and the information required to accomplish them. The result of GDTA is a list of information (SA elements) that are categorized into the three SA levels. However, GDTA-based studies typically categorize SA elements into the three SA levels without stating their categorization rules. Therefore, this article proposes a taxonomy to categorize SA elements obtained via GDTA into SA levels. First, we present the results of a systematic literature review (N = 87) to gain insight into how analysts apply their classification criteria. Then, we propose a categorization taxonomy based on the ISO 15939 standard. To validate the proposed taxonomy, we analyze a subset of GDTA results in two cases, and the results of the analysis show that the proposed categorization rules are applicable to the two analyzed cases. © 2013 IEEE.', 'Job analysis; Classification criterion; Cognitive task analysis; Complex environments; Gain insight; Goal-directed task analysis; Human operator; Situation awareness; Systematic literature review; Taxonomies', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103891864&doi=10.1109%2fTHMS.2021.3066456&partnerID=40&md5=ef1c128bf91df5e1032b1d02465a8d7d', ['literature review', 2, 'review match']]\n",

While the building information modeling (BIM) approach plays an important role in such a transition, more and more technological approaches are emerging and grouped together under the concept of Construction 4.0. However, the contours of Construction 4.0 as a scientific domain are far from being clearly defined. A few literature reviews have been published in an attempt to clarify its meaning and define its enabling technologies, but do not provide a complete view of the research efforts. To fully understand the research effort, it is necessary to study the different communities and clusters, their weights and their interrelationships. This paper proposes a mapping of the Construction 4.0 research themes and clusters over 10\\xa0years of scientific publications, using a systematic literature review approach. 2444 papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2010 and 2019 were identified and the associated keywords were analyzed in order to highlight their co-occurrences. The research shows how BIM plays a central role in the digital transformation, hiding a forest of emerging technologies represented by the main clusters identified. Of the 10 main enabling technologies in 2018, only three were already mentioned in 2010. Some of these technologies (Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, 3D printing and Big Data) seem to be in the position to occupy an increasingly important place in the coming years. It seems more difficult for other technologies (e.g., cyber physical systems) to find an important place, due to a lack of awareness in the industry.

In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes).

In this study, a new CLSC network is designed for the walnut industry as a part of agricultural crop by conducting a complete review of the past studies. Therefore, a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for the proposed network is developed minimizing the overall costs of the walnut industry. The designed network considers both forward and reverse flow not only to meet the demands of various markets, but also to prepare the returned products for the second use. In order to solve the proposed model, a set of exact, metaheuristics, and hybrid metaheuristics are employed.

An improvement to the operational efficiency and the productivity of warehouses is crucial for supply chain practitioners and industrial managers. Overall warehouse efficiency largely depends on synergic performance. The managers preemptively estimate the overall warehouse performance (OWP), which requires an accurate prediction of a warehouse's key performance indicators (KPIs). This research aims to predict the KPIs of a ready-made garment (RMG) warehouse in Bangladesh with a low forecasting error in order to precisely measure OWP. Incorporating advice from experts, conducting a literature review, and accepting the limitations of data availability, this study identifies 13 KPIs. The traditional grey method (GM) - the GM (1, 1) model - is established to estimate the grey data with limited historical information but not absolute. To reduce the limitations of GM (1, 1), this paper introduces a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based grey model - PSOGM (1, 1) - to predict the warehouse's KPIs with less forecasting error. This study also uses the genetic algorithm (GA)-based grey model - GAGM (1, 1) - the discrete grey model - DGM (1, 1) - to assess the performance of the proposed model in terms of the mean absolute percentage error and other assessment metrics. The proposed model outperforms the existing grey models in projecting OWP through the forecasting of KPIs over a 5-month period. To find out the optimal parameters of the PSO and GA algorithms before combining them with the grey model, this study adopts the Taguchi design method. Finally, this study aims to help warehouse professionals make quick OWP estimations in advance to take control measures regarding warehouse productivity and efficiency. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The interviewer’s voice and the silences are removed from the audio records as a preprocessing task. Several audio features are extracted from the patient's speech to achieve this task. For instance, MFCC’s, Spectral Centroid, Spectral Roll-Off Point, and others. We trained and compared three families of classifiers (SVM, Random Tree, and Random Forest) through two experiments, one using Spectral feature variants and MFCC, and the other using only MFCC features.

In all cases, we used a bootstrapping method to solve the sampling bias, i.e., 70% of the patients not suffering from depression. From the results, the MFCC feature set was more appropriate for tree-based classifiers than SVM, in which the Random Tree classifier reported the highest classification performance (91.3%).

Yet several open-source as well as commercial software projects have adopted peer code review as a crucial practice to ensure the quality of their software products using modern tool-based code review. Nevertheless, the selection of peer reviewers is still merely a manual and hard task especially with the growing size of distributed development teams. Indeed, it has been proven that inappropriate peer reviewers selection can consume more time and effort from both developers and reviewers and increase the development costs and time to market. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-objective search-based approach, named WhoReview, to find the optimal set of peer reviewers for code changes. We use the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) to find the best set of code reviewers that are (1) most experienced with the code change to be reviewed, while (2) considering their current workload, i.e., the number of open code reviews they are working on. We conduct an empirical study on 4 long-lived open source software projects to evaluate our approach.

The literature describes several SIAs. However, the selection of an identification approach that is suitable for a practitioner is difficult because it depends on several factors, including the goal of modernization, the available legacy artifacts, the organization's development process, the desired output, and the usability of the approach. Accordingly, to select a suitable service identification approach, a practitioner must have a comprehensive view of existing techniques. We report a systematic literature review (SLR) that covers 41 SIAs based on software-systems analyses. Based on this SLR, we create a taxonomy of SIAs and build a multi-layer classification of existing identification approaches. We start from a high-level classification based on the used inputs, the applied processes, the given outputs, and the usability of the SIAs. We then divide each category into a fine-grained taxonomy that helps practitioners in selecting a suitable approach for identifying services in legacy software systems. We build our SLR based on our experience with legacy software modernization, on discussions and experiences working with industrial partners, and analyses of existing SIAs. We validate the correctness and the coverage of our review with industrial experts who modernize(d) legacy software systems to SOA. The results show that our classification conforms to the industrial experts’ experiences. We also show that most of the studied SIAs are still at their infancy.

Real-time processing of images to highlight important anatomical structures combined with in-situ display, has the potential to greatly facilitate the acquisition and interpretation of iUS images when guiding an operation. In order to take full advantage of the recent advances in machine learning, large amounts of high-quality annotated training data are necessary to develop and validate the algorithms. To ensure efficient collection of a sufficient number of patient images and external validity of the models, training data should be collected at several centers by different neurosurgeons, and stored in a standard format directly compatible with the most commonly used machine learning toolkits and libraries. In this paper, we argue that such effort to collect and organize large-scale multi-center datasets should be based on common open source software and databases.

Therefore, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is considered as a promising alternative to overcome this challenge. The near-field magnetic WPT approach is a common-used way to power-up active implants wirelessly. Although many improvements have made on the implant’s design and their remote powering approaches, stringent requirements and several parameters should be considered during the design of the WPT system, such as the power transfer efficiency, the transfer distance, the implant size, and its biocompatibility. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the commonly proposed approaches to power-up IMDs have been reviewed. In particular, various advanced mechanisms and technical solutions related to the Near-field magnetic WPT approach have been discussed. These solutions are carried out to optimize transcutaneous WPT transfer efficiency, maintaining robustness and safety against many factors such as coil misalignments and load variations.

We determined the key authors, significant studies, and the collaboration patterns that were not considered by the previous publications on this angel of supply chain management. Using citation and co-citation analysis, key supply chain areas that blockchain could contribute are pinpointed as supply chain management, finance, logistics, and security. Furthermore, it revealed that Internet of Things (IoT) and smart contracts are the leading emerging technologies in this field. The results of highly cited and co-cited articles demonstrate that blockchain could enhance transparency, traceability, efficiency, and information security in supply chain management. The analysis also revealed that empirical research is scarce in this field.

The main observation is that planning models that focus on all three sustainability dimensions in the petroleum sector are scarce. Regarding the environmental dimension, the analysis demonstrates that consideration of greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2 impacts, is dominating planning models. Furthermore, there is an absence of quantitative models that include social dimensions, and this gap must be addressed in the future.

A literature review was carried out on 21 scientific publications in which the Two-Zone model was used to assess occupational exposure to solvent vapors. Data on exposure scenarios, solvents, generation/emission rates, near- and far-field parameters, and model performance were collected and analyzed. Over the 24 exposure scenarios identified, 18 were evaluated under controlled conditions, 5 under normal workplace activities, and 1 was reported based on literature data. The scenarios involved a variety of tasks which consisted, mostly, of cleaning metal parts, spraying solvents onto surfaces, spilling liquids, and filling containers with volatile substances. Twenty-eight different solvents were modeled and the most commonly tested were benzene, toluene, and acetone. Emission rates were considered constant in 16 scenarios, exponentially decreasing in 6 scenarios, and intermittent in 2 scenarios. Four-hundred-and-forty-six (446) predicted-to-measured concentration ratios were calculated across the 21 studies; 441 were obtained in controlled conditions, 4 under normal workplace activities, and 1 was calculated based on the literature data. For controlled studies, the Two-Zone model predictive performance was within a factor of 0.3–3.7 times the measured concentrations with 93% of the values between 0.5 and 2. The model overestimated the measured concentrations in 63% of the evaluations. The median predicted concentration for the near-field was 1.38 vs. 1.02 for the far-field. Results suggest that the model might be a useful tool for predicting occupational exposure to vapors of solvents by providing a conservative approach. Harmonization in model testing strategies and data presentation is needed in future studies to improve the assessment of the predictability of the Two-Zone model.

In this review, these mechanisms, taking place during both the initi-ation and propagation steps of photodegradation, are discussed concerning graphene and graphene derivatives, i.e., graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In particular, graphene displays important UV absorption, free radical scavenging, and quenching capabilities thanks to the abundant π-bonds and sp2 carbon sites in its hexagonal lattice structure. The free radical scavenging effect is also partially linked with functional hydroxyl groups on the surface. However, the sp2 sites remain the predominant player, which makes graphene’s antioxidant effect potentially stronger than rGO and GO. Besides, UV screening and oxygen barriers are active protective mechanisms attributed to graphene’s high surface area and 2D geometry. Moreover, the way that graphene, as a nucleating agent, can improve the photostability of polymers, have been explored as well. These include the potential effect of graphene on increasing polymer’s glass transition temperature and crystallinity. © 2020 by the authors.

PSD is typically used to characterize broadband random signals and has a variety of usages in many fields like physics, engineering, biomedical, etc. This paper proposes a simple and practical method to estimate the PSD based on the Welch algorithm for spectrum monitoring. The proposed method can be easily implemented in most of software-based systems or low-level Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and yields a smooth overview of the spectrum. The original Welch method utilizes the average of the amplitude squared of the previous Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) samples for better estimation of frequency components and noise reduction. Replacing the simple moving average with a weighted moving average can significantly reduce the complexity of the Welch’s method. In this way, the amount of required Random Access Memory (RAM) is reduced from K (where K is the number of FFT packets in averaging) to one. This new method allows users to adjust the dependency of the PSD on the previous observed FFTs and its smoothness by setting only one feedback parameter without any hardware change. The obtained results show that the algorithm gives a clear spectrum, even in the noisy situation because of the significant Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) enhancement. The trade-off between spectrum accuracy and time convergence of the modified algorithm is also fully analysed. In addition, a simple solution based on Xilinx Intellectual Property (IP), which converts the proposed method to a practical spectrum analyzer device, is presented. This modified algorithm is validated by comparing it with two standard and reliable spectrum analyzers, Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) and Tektronix RSA600. The modified design can track any signal type as the other spectrum analyzers, and it has better performance in situations where the power of the desired signal is weak or where the signal is mixed with the background noise. It can display the spectrum when the input signal power is 5 dB lower than the visible threshold level of R&S and Tektronix. In both narrowband and wideband scenarios, the new implemented design can still display frequency components 5 dB higher than the noise, while the output spectrum of other analyzers is completely covered by noise. © 2020 by the authors.

However, purely FEM-based mechanical simulations require considerable time, limiting their use in clinical applications that require real-time responses, such as haptics simulators. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to help with the reduction of the required time. The present paper reviews cases where ML could help to generate faster simulations, without considerably affecting the performance results. Methods: This review details the ML approaches used, considering the anatomical structures involved, the data collection strategies, the selected ML algorithms, with corresponding features, the metrics used for validation, and the resulting time gains. Results: A total of 41 references were found. ML algorithms are mainly trained with FEM-based simulations in 32 publications. The preferred ML approach is neural networks, including deep learning in 35 publications. Tissue deformation is simulated in 18 applications, but other features are also considered. The average distance error and mean squared error are the most frequently used performance metrics, in 14 and 17 publications, respectively. The time gains were considerable, going from hours or minutes for purely FEM-based simulations to milliseconds, when using ML. Conclusions: ML algorithms can be used to accelerate FEM-based biomechanical simulations of anatomical structures, possibly reaching real-time responses.

Thus, to measure deflection, for example, we use a deflectometer or a Benkelman beam. If you want to assess the deterioration of the road surface or count the vehicles passing on a road, then technicians must make a visual analysis of the road. In the same vein, most of the available research evaluates the results of data extraction and does so mainly visually. So, when a frame of reference is available, an adjustment is made to modify the database. This is where IoT (Internet of Things) comes in place by creating a simple automation process to standardize the data and transform them in information to create a database and measure the quantity and quality of the deformation with a Neural Network. The data set has been categorized manually into different types of deterioration, allowing it to be measured quantitatively and qualitatively.

Furthermore, a lack of consistency can be observed in the used terms for discussions on temporal considerations. The purpose of this review is thus to search for common ground and to identify the current implementation challenges while also proposing development pathways. This paper introduces a glossary of the most frequently used terms related to temporal considerations in LCA to build a common understanding of key concepts and to facilitate discussions. A review is also performed on current solutions for temporal considerations in different LCA phases (goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis and life cycle impact assessment), analysing each temporal consideration for its relevant conceptual developments in LCA and its level of operationalisation. We then present a potential stepwise approach and development pathways to address the current challenges of implementation for dynamic LCA (DLCA). Three key focal areas for integrating temporal considerations within the LCA framework are discussed: i) define the temporal scope over which temporal distributions of emissions are occurring, ii) use calendar-specific information to model systems and associated impacts, and iii) select the appropriate level of temporal resolution to describe the variations of flows and characterisation factors. Addressing more temporal considerations within a DLCA framework is expected to reduce uncertainties and increase the representativeness of results, but possible trade-offs between additional data collection efforts and the increased value of results from DLCAs should be kept in mind. © 2020', 'Economic and social effects; Conceptual development; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life Cycle Inventory; Life cycle inventory analysis; Specific information; Temporal distribution; Temporal resolution; Life cycle; conceptual framework; development strategy; emission; temporal analysis; temporal distribution; uncertainty analysis; human; life cycle assessment; review; uncertainty', 'Review', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088115137&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.140700&partnerID=40&md5=0a946075ad242a044420a5f842ca9cbd', ['review match']]\n",

This paper analyzes and discusses the findings of 77 selected studies published from 2000 to 2018 according to the following criteria: maintainability prediction techniques, validation methods, accuracy criteria, overall accuracy of ML techniques, and the techniques offering the best performance. The review process followed the well-known systematic review process. The results show that ML techniques are frequently used in predicting maintainability. In particular, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine/regression (SVM/R), regression & decision trees (DT), and fuzzy & neuro fuzzy (FNF) techniques are more accurate in terms of PRED and MMRE. The N-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation methods, and the MMRE and PRED accuracy criteria are frequently used in empirical studies.

In order to secure cleaner work parts and environment as well as reduced machining expenses, less fuel consumption is highly recommended. However, the quality of machined parts in the absence of fluid is considered a delicate subject. Under such conditions, the quality of machining process, as well as productivity, could be evaluated by different parameters and criteria including edge and surface quality, chip thickness, cutting force, and tool wear and life, which all seem to be highly influenced by many factors, including lubrication mode (dry and wet) and chip evacuation process. In order to take the benefits while avoiding the disadvantages of lubricated machining, novel lubrication method the so-called minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), which is micro lubrication near dry machining, is proposed. Review of literature denotes that under MQL condition, a low volume of information is available on the effects of mineral and bio-lubricants and various levels of flow rate on machining attributes, in principle average surface roughness (Ra) and chip thickness (hc) when machining aluminum alloys (AAs). To remedy the lack of knowledge determined, the effects of cutting conditions, in principle cutting speed, feed rate, lubricant, and various levels of flow rate on Ra and hc in MQL turning of AA 6061-T6 and AA 7076-T6, are presented. Therefore, three different experimental models, including multiplicative, 2-factor interactions (2FI), and linear models, were used in this study to assess the effects of cutting parameters on the machining outputs. According to experimental observations and despite the design models used, both Ra and hc are statistically significant responses and could be controlled by variation of the cutting parameters used. A strong relationship can be formulated between both responses and experimental parameters used. Although negligible, however, biodegradable cutting fluid with higher viscosity denoted better capability to improve the surface finish. The use of a higher flow rate also led to improved surface finish (up to 50%). It was observed that despite the material used, both flow rate and cutting fluid have insignificant effects on hc. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.', 'Aircraft engines; Aluminum alloys; Cutting; Cutting fluids; Finishing; Flow rate; Lubricants; Lubrication; Machining centers; Quality control; Surface roughness; Turning; Average surface roughness; Cutting conditions; Environmental pollutions; Experimental models; Experimental parameters; Machining operations; Minimum quantity lubrication; Near dry machining; Cutting tools', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090067576&doi=10.1007%2fs00170-020-05979-3&partnerID=40&md5=45c9995e94e8eb33627a0f6221ffcb39', ['review match']]\n",

Moreover, diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia is challenging as patients can report significant symptoms but may not meet diagnostic criteria on standard objective tests. Advanced analyses of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity could provide objective markers of idiopathic hypersomnia and explain part of its pathophysiology and heterogeneity. In fact, the EEG signal recorded during wakefulness and sleep not only captures sleep macroarchitecture but also homeostatic sleep process efficiency, strength of neural synchrony during sleep, sleep consolidation, and changes in cognitive processes. In this review, we will present current and potential markers of idiopathic hypersomnia, with a focus on sleep propensity. We will also discuss EEG changes occurring in sleep deprivation conditions and recovery nights, as well as those observed in other central hypersomnolence conditions, namely narcolepsy type-1 and type-2. Recent Findings: Among EEG markers studied in sleep deprivation and narcolepsy are those derived from sleep macroarchitecture (sleep consolidation, sleep stage proportion, sleep-stage transitions, sleep onset in rapid-eye movement sleep) and microarchitecture (slow-wave activity, spindles), spectral analysis of the waking electroencephalographic signal, and cognitive event–related potentials. To date, no clear objective EEG markers of idiopathic hypersomnia exist, as studies were generally performed on small samples, used heterogeneous protocols (including changes of diagnostic criteria that occurred over time), and most of them focused on more traditional macroarchitecture sleep analyses. Summary: Based on studies of sleep deprivation and narcolepsy, further studies are needed to understand the EEG signal in idiopathic hypersomnia. Future studies should take advantage of the richness and the complexity of the EEG signal and verify whether subgroups of hypersomniac patients exist. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.', 'alpha rhythm; bispectral index; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; electromyography; executive function; eye movement; heart rate; human; hypersomnia; local field potential; machine learning; memory consolidation; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; phenotype; polysomnography; priority journal; REM sleep; Review; sleep deprivation; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; sleep stage; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; somatosensory cortex; spreading cortical depression; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; wakefulness', 'Review', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088633227&doi=10.1007%2fs40675-020-00173-z&partnerID=40&md5=37c8c585ca80b125bc92c8751d00542e', ['review match']]\n",

The winding is then influenced by both skin and proximity phenomenon, which makes the current distribution uneven resulting in an increased resistance. The study of improving AC resistance of a PCB winding has been tackled by many researchers. However, the lack of an overview and comparison among improvements has made it difficult to apply those methods to a specific winding. To overcome the above limitations, this paper investigates the pros and cons of three popular AC resistance optimizing methods: optimizing track width of a solid PCB winding, using multi-strands and using Litz style PCB winding. To verify the theoretical analysis, a total of 12 PCBs are simulated by finite element (FEM) and tested in the laboratory. Five criteria are analyzed, including skin resistance, proximity resistance, AC to DC ratio, total AC resistance and complexity are taken into consideration. The results of this study show that optimizing track width method has a significant improvement on AC resistance while the use of Litz PCB is effective for applications that need stable AC resistance in a wide frequency range. The use of parallel strands winding should be carefully considered as there is not significant benefit in both reducing the AC resistance and AC to DC ratio. © 2020 by the authors.

Then, reviewers provide their feedback to developers, and may request further modifications before finally accepting or rejecting the submitted code changes. However, the identification of appropriate reviewers is still a tedious task as the number of code reviews to be performed is inflated with the increasing number of code changes and the increasing size of software development teams in today's large and active software projects. To help developers with the review process, we introduce a multi-objective search-based approach to find the appropriate set of reviewers. We use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize two conflicting objectives (i) maximize reviewers expertise with the changed files, and (ii) minimize reviewers workload in terms of their current open code reviews.

Materials and Methods: In this institutional review board approved–study, a total of 1830 posteroanterior radiographs of patients with AIS (age range, 10–18 years, 70% female) were collected retrospectively and graded manually by six trained readers using the United States Risser staging system. Each radiograph was preprocessed and cropped to include the entire pelvic region. A convolutional neural network was trained to automatically grade conventional radiographs according to the Risser classification. The network was then vali-dated by comparing its accuracy against the interobserver variability of six trained graders from the authors’ institution using the Fleiss k statistical measure. Results: Overall agreement between the six observers was fair, with a k coefficient of 0.65 for the experienced graders and agreement of 74.5%. The automatic grading method obtained a k coefficient of 0.72, which is a substantial agreement with the ground truth, and an overall accuracy of 78.0%. Conclusion: The high accuracy of the model presented here compared with human readers suggests that this work may provide a new method for standardization of Risser grading.

Moreover, the available resources may not be utilized effectively by alloted users thereby resulting in inefficiency and user unfairness. This imposes a severe drawback in cases where the number of users to be served are high, like in the Internet of Things or ultra-dense 5G networks. Hence, introducing non-orthogonality to multiple access scheme is advocated as a superior methodology to serve multiple users simultaneously, thereby achieving multi-fold enhancement in connectivity.

This poses a security concern about the safety of machine learning models since the adversarial attacks can fool such models toward the wrong predictions. In this paper we first review some strong adversarial attacks that may affect both audio signals and their 2D representations and evaluate the resiliency of deep learning models and support vector machines (SVM) trained on 2D audio representations such as short time Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and cross recurrent plot against several state-of-theart adversarial attacks. Next, we propose a novel approach based on pre-processed DWT representation of audio signals and SVM to secure audio systems against adversarial attacks. The proposed architecture has several preprocessing modules for generating and enhancing spectrograms including dimension reduction and smoothing. We extract features from small patches of the spectrograms using the speeded up robust feature (SURF) algorithm which are further used to transform into cluster distance distribution using the K-Means++ algorithm. Finally, SURF-generated vectors are encoded by this codebook and the resulting codewords are used for training a SVM. All these steps yield to a novel approach for audio classification that provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and resilience. Experimental results on three environmental sound datasets show the competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to the deep neural networks both in terms of accuracy and robustness against strong adversarial attacks. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

The objective of this work was to review the procedure developed by SWI-NaOH-OCE Model for the valorization of biomass through controlled direct combustion and the sequestration of hydrogen gas for energy needs. The incineration model gave a lead to the sequestration of emissions released during the direct combustion of biomass and the subsequent entrapment of oxides of carbon and the eventual release of abundant hydrogen gas in the entrapment jar. The generation of geomaterials ash for the purpose of soil stabilization, concrete and asphalt modification has encouraged greenhouse emissions but eventually the technology that has been put in place has made it possible to manage and extract these emissions for energy needs. The contribution from researchers has shown that hydrogen sequestration from other sources requires high amount of energy because of the lower energy states of the compounds undergoing thermal decomposition. But this work has presented a more efficient approach to release hydrogen gas, which can easily be extracted and stored to meet the energy needs of the future as fuel cell batteries to power vehicles, mobile devices, robotic systems, etc. More so, the development of MXene as an exfoliated two-dimensional nanosheets with permeability and filtration selectivity properties, which are connected to its chemical composition and structure used in hydrogen gas extraction and separation from its molecular combination, has presented an efficient procedure for the production and management of hydrogen gas for energy purposes. © 2020', '', 'Review', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101551687&doi=10.1016%2fj.mset.2019.11.003&partnerID=40&md5=ece4e952eadaee74fedcf5a74ff464b5', ['review match']]\n",

The water resources in the developing countries is fast threatened by lack of engineered waste disposal facilities in different locations resulting to water pollution and its unhealthy consequences.

Geotechnical engineering in this paper promises to serve as a locus to bring these threatening environmental conditions into workable and beneficial stream.

Secondly, the utilization of these derivatives, which serve as alternative cement in stabilization of soft soils, partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete production and modifier in asphalt production presents construction successes devoid of CO2 emission because these materials are eco-friendly. Lastly, by adapting the use of these materials in soft soil, concrete and asphalt strength improvement, the solid wastes find a disposal path through the recycling process and eventual utilization as geomaterials, concrete additives and asphalt modification materials sources.

It also presents a comparison of the predictions of current design standards (ACI 440.2R 2017; CSA/S6 2019; CSA/S806 2012; fib-TG9.3 2001) with the results of experimental tests reported in the literature. The study shows that major parameters influencing the shear behaviour have received little attention. These parameters include in particular: (i) the presence and ratio of internal transverse steel reinforcement and (ii) the number of EB FRP plies (layers). This may explain the observed discrepancies between the prediction models of existing equations for shear resistance and the results obtained from tests. Consequently, a database extracted from the experimental studies was developed as part of this study. The results obtained highlight and confirm the existence of an interaction between the EB FRP composites and the internal transverse steel reinforcement with regard to shear resistance of RC beams.

The final list of the frameworks’ drivers was validated and refined using a survey. Results suggested that, beside risks and uncertainty, technologies maturity, degree of change in design, ambiguity of requirements, functional decompositions, severity of standards, process overlapping and variety of key stakeholders drive effort and time as complexity drivers while processes maturity, experience with technology, risk management, change management, level of trust in suppliers and team skills drive effort and time as proficiency drivers. © 2020, © 2020 American Society for Engineering Management.', 'Aerospace engineering; Aerospace industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Human resource management; Risk management; Functional decomposition; Literature reviews; New product development; New product development projects; Postmortem analysis; Product development programs; Product development projects; Risks and uncertainties; Product development', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088047563&doi=10.1080%2f10429247.2020.1772950&partnerID=40&md5=0a4ec5d4ee0daa791b84fdb19c999b61', ['Literature review', 2, 'review match']]\n",

Burning this fuel causes the release of polluting particles to the atmosphere and constitutes a direct cost attributed to fuel consumption. The optimization of various aircraft operations in different flight phases such as cruise and descent, as well as terminal area movements, have been identified as a way to reduce fuel requirements, thus reducing pollution. The goal of this chapter is to briefly explain and apply different metaheuristic optimization algorithms to improve the cruise flight phase cost in terms of fuel burn. Another goal is to present an overview of the most popular commercial aircraft models. The algorithms implemented for different optimization strategies are genetic algorithms, the artificial bee colony, and the ant colony algorithm. The fuel burn aircraft model used here is in the form of a Performance Database. A methodology to create this model using a Level D aircraft research flight simulator is briefly explained. Weather plays an important role in flight optimization, and so this work explains a method for incorporating open source weather. The results obtained for the optimization algorithms show that every optimization algorithm was able to reduce the flight consumption, thereby reducing the pollution emissions and contributing to airlines’ profit margins. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.', 'Aircraft; Ant colony optimization; Flight simulators; Fuels; Pollution; Aircraft operations; Aircraft trajectory; Commercial aircraft; Direct costs; Flight phase; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Power; Trajectory optimization; Genetic algorithms', 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075556401&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-9806-3_2&partnerID=40&md5=7fb754d3ba34e5382dc52b0be923bfd6', ['overview', 1]]\n",

The thermomechanical treatment of Ti–Ni SMA comprising cold rolling (CR) and post-deformation annealing (PDA) forms a nanocrystalline structure (NCS) providing much higher functional properties than normal coarse-grained structure. The NCS consisting of grains surrounded by high-angle boundaries (“nanograined structure,” NGS) provides higher static shape memory properties than the NCS consisting of subgrains separated by low-angle (< 15°) boundaries (“nanosubgrained structure,” NSS), whereas a mixed NS + NG structure provides the best functional fatigue properties. The following evolution of NCS types formed as a result of PDA is observed: when the CR strain increases from moderate (a true strain e about 0.3) to intermediate (e = 0.5–1) and then to severe (e > 1) levels, the NSS transforms to the mixed NSS + NGS and then to the NGS. The NS structures observed in Ti–Ni after intermediate or severe CR and after PDA do not significantly differ from each other in TEM images. This is due to the development of dynamic polygonization during CR which continues as the static polygonization during PDA. A moderate CR does not reach the dynamic polygonization stage, its dislocation substructure transforms to a statically polygonized NSS upon PDA. © 2019, ASM International.', 'Cold rolling; Nanocrystals; Nickel alloys; Nickel metallography; Shape-memory alloy; Thermomechanical treatment; Titanium metallography; Functional properties; Nano-crystalline structures; NiTi; Polygonization; Shape memory; Structural properties', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075342378&doi=10.1007%2fs40830-019-00241-6&partnerID=40&md5=fa380d5e5c001c4c14f711064b4e17ad', ['Brief Review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

Methods: A literature search led to the identification of 1582 potential studies. Included studies had to include physical exercise with sufficient details on the type, duration, intensity, and provide valid performance measures and a cooling intervention administered during exercise with sufficient details on the type and site of application. Results: Forty-five studies were included. Per-cooling provides a performance benefit during ‘aerobic’ (standardized mean difference (SMD) of\\xa00.60, P\\xa0<.001)\\xa0and ‘anaerobic’ exercises (SMD\\xa0=\\xa00.27, P\\xa0<.02).\\xa0The effects were greater during aerobic compared to anaerobic exercises (P\\xa0<.01). Internal cooling (cold fluid ingestion such as cold water and ice slurry/menthol beverage) and external cooling (face, neck, and torso) provide the greatest performance benefit for ‘aerobic’ performance with a moderate to large effect (0.46\\xa0<\\xa0SMD\\xa0<\\xa01.24). For ‘anaerobic’ exercises, wearing a whole-body cooling garment is the best way to enhance exercise performance (SMD\\xa0=\\xa00.39, P\\xa0<.01). Conclusion: Per-cooling improves ‘aerobic’ and ‘anaerobic’ exercise performance with a greater benefit for ‘aerobic’ exercise.

This paper uses a systematic literature review approach to map the BIM research themes and clusters over ten years of scientific publications. 1244 articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2016 were selected and the associated metadata analyzed in order to highlight co-occurrences in author's keywords. It appears that a few “big players” dominate the keywords, while most of the keywords used by authors are much less cited. Seven core clusters are identified using modularity optimization techniques: industry foundation classes, information technology, facility management, building, collaboration, computer aided design, and laser scanning. © 2019 The author(s).

Overexposure to crystalline silica can cause health problems, in particular silicosis. This fatal lung disease persists worldwide despite knowledge of methods to control it. One way to partially overcome the problem of subjectivity and try to achieve objective experimental results is to run field crystalline silica dust surveys with trained human assessors (panelists). Such field inspections allow the determination of ambient air concentrations and are now seen as being a more convenient method for UFP impact assessment in the field. One drawback of field inspections is that they can get rather expensive, especially if the survey is conducted for an extended period of time involving a high number of panelists. This paper reviews the techniques that can be adopted to measure UFPs in the field and discusses how such techniques can be used as an alternative to, or in combination with, gas tracer dispersion methods for UFP impact assessment purposes, and how the results of field UFP measurements and model outputs can be related and compared to each other. Two simulation methods were used to study crystalline silica dust exposure during the granite polishing process (experimental and numerical). This study presents a method to measure UFP dispersion during granite manufacturing processes. A computational model was constructed to simulate the physical problem. The numerical study was carried out, on a simplified configuration (bench), modeling particle distribution near a rotating tool. CFD simulation results were compared to the experimental data using NaCl particles, a tracer gas (CO 2 ), and UFP dispersion from granite polishing. The results showed good agreement between the two methods. © 2019, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.', '', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062655251&doi=10.1007%2fs41810-018-00038-7&partnerID=40&md5=d80d30de7811f13665c2f715ed4b8394', ['review match']]\n",

It is required when the soil available for construction is not suitable to carry structural load. Generally, soils exhibit undesirable engineering properties unless they are treated to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and control its shrink-swell properties, thereby improving the load bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavement and its foundations. Soil stabilization is used to reduce permeability and compressibility of the soil mass in earth structures and to increase its shear strength. Mixing additives into the reaction mechanism, positively affecting its strength, improving and maintaining the soil moisture content, achieve stabilization. Therefore, these soil stabilization processes are suggested for most construction systems and can be accomplished by several methods. All these methods fall into two broad categories, namely mechanical stabilization and chemical stabilization. Mechanical Stabilization is the process of improving the properties of the soil by changing its gradation; chemical stabilization is the process of adding a physico-synthetic substance to the soil which reacts with the clay particles to fill the voids so that less water is needed to maintain a stable mix and, finally, a stable framework. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.', 'Additives; Bearing capacity; Bearings (machine parts); Road construction; Roads and streets; Shear strength; Soil moisture; Soil structure interactions; Soil surveys; Structural properties; Chemical stabilization; Construction systems; Engineering properties; Load-bearing capacity; Mechanical stabilization; Shear strength parameters; Shrink-swell properties; Soil-stabilization process; Stabilization', 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101313140&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-01911-2_3&partnerID=40&md5=c1fd5d4485036fe13cf6e8d2e005256e', ['Overview', 1]]\n",

In video-based FR systems, facial models of target individuals are designed a priori during enrollment using a limited number of reference still images or video data. These facial models are not typically representative of faces being observed during operations due to large variations in illumination, pose, scale, occlusion, blur, and camera interoperability. Specifically, in still-to-video FR application, a single high-quality reference still image captured with still camera under controlled conditions is employed to generate a facial model to be matched later against lower-quality faces captured with video cameras under uncontrolled conditions. Current video-based FR systems can perform well on controlled scenarios, while their performance is not satisfactory in uncontrolled scenarios mainly because of the differences between the source (enrollment) and the target (operational) domains.

In this study, we performed a systematic mapping and review on SPMP studies to analyze and summarize the empirical evidence on the prediction accuracy of SPMP techniques in current research. Objective: The objective of this study is twofold: (1) to classify SPMP studies reported in the literature using the following criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, empirical approach, software application type, datasets, independent variables used as predictors, dependent variables (e.g. how maintainability is expressed in terms of the variable to be predicted), tools used to gather the predictors, the successful predictors and SPMP techniques, (2) to analyze these studies from three perspectives: prediction accuracy, techniques reported to be superior in comparative studies and accuracy comparison of these techniques. Methodology: We performed a systematic mapping and review of the SPMP empirical studies published from 2000 up to 2018 based on an automated search of nine electronic databases. Results: We identified 82 primary studies and classified them according to the above criteria. The mapping study revealed that most studies were solution proposals using a history-based empirical evaluation approach, the datasets most used were historical using object-oriented software applications, maintainability in terms of the independent variable to be predicted was most frequently expressed in terms of the number of changes made to the source code, maintainability predictors most used were those provided by Chidamber and Kemerer (C&K), Li and Henry (L&H) and source code size measures, while the most used techniques were ML techniques, in particular artificial neural networks. Detailed analysis revealed that fuzzy & neuro fuzzy (FNF), artificial neural network (ANN) showed good prediction for the change topic, while multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and group method of data handling (GMDH) techniques presented greater accuracy prediction in comparative studies. Based on our findings SPMP is still limited. Developing more accurate techniques may facilitate their use in industry and well-formed, generalizable results be obtained. We also provide guidelines for improving the maintainability of software. © 2019 Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.

Improved tumor profiling capacity has enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of gliomas with the overarching goal to identify clinically relevant subtypes and inform treatment decisions. Increased tumor mutational load has been shown to correlate with higher levels of neoantigens and is indicative of the potential to induce a durable response to immunotherapy. Following treatment with TMZ, a subset of glioma has been identified to recur with increased tumor mutational load. These hypermutant recurrent glioma represent a subtype of recurrence with unique molecular vulnerabilities.

With the current design, these blockchain systems do not scale with additional nodes since every node executes every transaction. Further efforts are therefore necessary to develop scalable permissionless blockchain systems. In this paper, we provide an aggregated overview of the current research on the Ethereum blockchain towards solving the scalability challenge. We focus on the concept of sharding, which aims to break the restriction of every participant being required to execute every transaction and store the entire state. This concept however introduces new complexities in the form of stateless clients, which leads to a new challenge: how to guarantee that critical data is published and stays available for as long as it is relevant. We present an approach towards solving the data availability problem (DAP) that leverages synergy effects by reusing the validators from Casper. We then propose two distinct approaches for reliable collation proposal, state transition, and state verification in shard chains. One approach is based on verification by committees of Casper validators that execute transactions in proposed blocks using witness data provided by executors. The other approach relies on a proof of execution provided by the executor proposing the block and a challenge game, where other executors verify the proof. Both concepts rely on executors for long-term storage of shard chain state. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.', 'Blockchain; Digital storage; Middleware; Critical data; Data availability; Distributed systems; Long-term storage; Proof of stake; Sharding; State transitions; Synergy effect; Ethereum', 'Conference Paper', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061827610&doi=10.1145%2f3284764.3284769&partnerID=40&md5=6e43b9520075c740981057e58263cfeb', ['overview', 1]]\n",

Like the reference model (the NSHP-HMM), the proposed classifier brings the efficient training and decoding algorithms of 1-D HMM to the 2-D modeling of spatial data. Furthermore, in contrast to the reference model which suffers from the short 2-D context limitation, our model uses the NSHP Markov random field to describe the contextual information at a ’zone’ level rather than a ’pixel’ level; the goal is to extend the context in order to give a better modeling of the spatial property of an image. Therefore, the use of high-level features extracted directly on the gray-level or color zones is possible, unlike what is done in a recognition based on classical NSHP-HMM, where the model, mandatorily, operates at a pixel level on normalized binary images; consequently, the applicability of our model is more general compared to the classical NSHP-HMM. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach at two stages. Firstly, in the theoretical study, we show the advantage of our model over other HMM-based 2-D classifiers; this part constitutes by itself, to our knowledge, the first complete overview of 2-D recognition approaches. Secondly, the experimental evaluation performed on recognition of handwritten digits/words provides the effectiveness of the NSHPZ-HMM against all other HMM-based 2-D recognizers and shows a good potential for other image recognition applications. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.', 'Binary images; Character recognition; Efficiency; Image recognition; Image segmentation; Pixels; Zoning; Contextual information; Decoding algorithm; Experimental evaluation; High-level features; Markov Random Fields; Recognition engines; Spatial properties; Two Dimensional (2 D); Hidden Markov models', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050302426&doi=10.1007%2fs10489-018-1217-z&partnerID=40&md5=c363cbfb7a7fdd4983ce0fae9d58007a', ['overview', 1]]\n",

Permanent ice loss is causing reductions to dry season streamflow, which is coupled with shifting demands and control over water access and entitlements in the region. A full evaluation of hydrologic inputs is required to inform future water management in the relative absence of glaciers. Over the last decade, new studies have shown groundwater to be a significant component of the regional water budget during the dry season, and it cannot be ignored when accounting for water quality and quantity downstream of the Cordillera Blanca's alpine catchments. Distinctive common features of the Cordillera Blanca's proglacial catchments are sediment-filled valleys that were once under proglacial lake conditions. The combination of lake sediments with other alpine depositional features results in storage and interseasonal release of groundwater that comprises up to 80% of the valley's streamflow during the driest months of the year. We summarize the emerging understanding of hydrogeologic processes in proglacial headwater systems of the region's principal river, the Rio Santa, and make suggestions for future research that will more clearly characterize the spatial distribution of stored groundwater within the mountain range. As glaciers continue to recede, differences in aquifer thickness and groundwater residence time between alpine catchments in the region will increasingly control dry season water availability at the local and basin scale.

Since machining processes operate at severe deformation conditions, involving very high strain, strain rate, stress, and temperature, the modeling procedure is still a challenging task even with new advanced software and computers. Therefore, most of the published research works were mainly performed for the simplest configuration of machining known as orthogonal cutting, in which a plane strain deformation state is assumed. This configuration leads to reducing the number of elements in the FE model and the computational time of the solution, compared to conventional machining processes (turning, milling, and drilling). Nevertheless, FE modeling of orthogonal turning is still considered as an open-ended subject as most of the phenomena involved in the orthogonal turning process, which also exist in other machining operations, are not fully well understood. The present review article deals with finite element modeling of orthogonal machining process. The paper consists of several related parts. First, the fundamentals of the FE simulation of orthogonal turning process are briefly described. Then, a detailed review on the FE prediction of machining characteristics including chip morphology, cutting forces, cutting temperature, tool wear, and burr formation is provided. Also, the FE prediction of surface integrity characteristics including residual stresses and microstructural changes is discussed. The influence of input model and parameters including thermal, material, and frictional models as well as size and arrangement of elements on machining and surface integrity characteristics are explained as well. Both technical and statistical aspects of the FE simulation of orthogonal turning are treated.

One of the most promising MCS approaches is Dynamic Selection (DS), in which the base classifiers are selected on the fly, according to each new sample to be classified.

We propose an updated taxonomy based on the main characteristics found in a dynamic selection system: (1) The methodology used to define a local region for the estimation of the local competence of the base classifiers; (2) The source of information used to estimate the level of competence of the base classifiers, such as local accuracy, oracle, ranking and probabilistic models, and (3) The selection approach, which determines whether a single or an ensemble of classifiers is selected. We categorize the main dynamic selection techniques in the DS literature based on the proposed taxonomy. We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis, considering a total of 18 state-of-the-art dynamic selection techniques, as well as static ensemble combination and single classification models.

However, the routine statistical protocols cannot be directly applied because of challenges arising from nondetects or left-censored observations, which are concentration measurements below the detection limit of measuring instruments. Despite the existence of techniques based on survival analysis that can adjust for nondetects, these are seldom taken into account properly. A comprehensive review of the literature showed that managing policies regarding analysis of censored data do not always agree and that guidance from regulatory agencies may be outdated. Therefore, researchers and practitioners commonly resort to the most convenient way of tackling the censored data problem by substituting nondetects with arbitrary constants prior to data analysis, although this is generally regarded as a bias-prone approach. Hoping to improve the interpretation of concentration data, the present article aims to familiarize researchers in different disciplines with the significance of left-censored observations and provides theoretical and computational recommendations (under both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks) for adequate analysis of censored data.

To conduct burr removal from machined edges and holes, the costly and non-desirable secondary operation, so-called deburring, is demanded. The complexity and severity of deburring processes depend on several factors, including burr size, location, and the material to be deburred. Due to vast applications of aluminum alloys in numerous manufacturing sectors including automotive and aerospace industries, adequate knowledge of the most widely used deburring processes on aluminum alloys is demanded. However, surprisingly, despite the acute demands by numerous manufacturing sectors, no state of the art was found in the open literature about applicable deburring and edge-finishing methods for aluminum work parts. This lack is intended to be remedied in this work by providing an insight into the most widely used deburring and edge-finishing processes for aluminum work parts. To that end, several deburring classifications were proposed. The main highly used category of deburring techniques is mechanical deburring process which is related to the removal of various kinds of burr shapes and size by means of mechanical abrasion. In fact, mechanical deburring processes are the most widely used techniques due to versatility, flexibility, deburring rate, and acceptable cost. Among mechanical deburring methods, several methods including robotic, CNC, and manual deburring were presented in this work. A brief insight into the application of several other non-classified mechanical deburring processes was also presented. In addition, knowing that an accurate selection of deburring methods is highly dependent to proper understanding of the burr formation, therefore, an overview of burr formation mechanism, morphology, shape, and, in principle, those factors governing burr formation are also presented, followed by experimental, numerical, and analytical models of burr formation morphology and size. Other general concerns, including the use of lubricant and its effects on deburring performance, must be identified. The future demands of precision deburring are challenging, not only for machine tools and deburring tools, but also for high-precision machining researchers. Close collaborations between machine tool builders, CAD/CAM programmers for precision tool path planning, and deburring and edge-finishing R & D community are highly demanded towards the successful movement to the next generation of precision deburring and edge finishing. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd.', 'Aerospace industry; Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Computer aided design; Machine tools; Manufacture; Motion planning; Numerical methods; Burr; Edge finishing; High precision machining; Machine tool builders; Manufacturing sector; Mechanical deburring; Morphology and size; Secondary operations; Deburring', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033386688&doi=10.1007%2fs00170-017-1288-8&partnerID=40&md5=965dc40fcddc6b584e3f6570b2b68809', ['overview', 1, 'review match']]\n",

Exergy analysis is proposed and lifted to study the industrial sector. Even though exergy analysis has been applied to study societies, few studies have been conducted to study emerging-market economies. In 2015, Mexico's crude oil production was the 12th biggest worldwide, therefore fossil fuels are still the main source to produce energy for the domestic and productive sectors of the Mexican society. Consequently, a prospective study case in Mexico is suggested. The industrial sectorial exergy consumption amounts 1350 PJ in 2000, increasing to 1591 PJ in 2015. Both energy and exergy efficiencies show similar results along the 16 years, with average energy and exergy efficiencies of 78% and 23%, respectively. In comparison with results of similar studies, Mexican exergy efficiency falls within the ranges, yet below the average of 48%. Thus, poor efficiency is still occurring in the sector.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to create a matrix of criteria that will eventually be used to design a personal cooling vest that will meet the needs and wants of miners. METHODS: A literature review was done to identify the constraints and requirements of miners in ultra-deep mining conditions; a field study was conducted in which information was acquired by measurement (temperature, humidity), observation (work rate) and semi-directed interviews of a convenience sample, 20 volunteer participants (age, weight, height, shirt size, personal protective equipment currently worn and opinion about a cooling vest). The data was then structured, compiled and interpreted to create a matrix. RESULTS: Participants were found to be in the > 50% percentile of the population regarding weight and height. All reacted positively to the idea of a cooling vest to help in their work. A matrix containing nine users and seven design-related criteria was created.

One of the most substantial of these issues is perhaps how to effectively rehabilitate and/or maintain the existing road network while preserving and sustaining limited natural resources. The re-usage of existing pavement materials to reconstruct/rehabilitate our future pavements is the solution that is now more and more selected by the different road administrations around the world. However, upon closer inspection, one can find many areas and details, not negligible issues, that are simply extensions of HMA technology (i.e. mix design process in cold recycling) or empirical arrangements; in particular RAP still does not have an internationally recognized classification. So SIB – TG6 decided to develop a classification protocol of RAP, depending on its intended application. The objective has been followed by considering the procedures generally utilized to classify the natural aggregates: tests able to identify the main components (i.e. the geometrical and mechanical properties of aggregates and the characterization of recovered bitumen for RAP) and provide information on their behaviour under specific conditions, near to real life usage (e.g. the Los Angeles test for aggregates gives an idea of the potential behaviour of aggregates under the action of a roller compactor).

However, a literature review reveals that mouse contusion studies using equivalent protocols may show large disparities in the observed impact force vs. cord compression relationship. The overall purpose of this study was to investigate possible sources of bias in these measurements. The specific objective was to improve spinal cord compression measurements using a video-based setup to detect the impactor-spinal cord time-to-contact. New method A force-controlled 30 kDyn unilateral contusion at C4 vertebral level was performed in six mice with the Infinite Horizon impactor (IH). High-speed video was used to determine the time-to-contact between the impactor tip and the spinal cord and to compute the related displacement of the tip into the tissue: the spinal cord compression and the compression ratio. Results & comparison with existing method(s) Delayed time-to-contact detection with the IH device led to an underestimation of the cord compression. Compression values indicated by the IH were 64% lower than those based on video analysis (0.33 mm vs. 0.88 mm). Consequently, the mean compression ratio derived from the device was underestimated when compared to the value derived from video analysis (22% vs. 61%). Conclusions Default time-to-contact detection from the IH led to significant errors in spinal cord compression assessment. Accordingly, this may explain some of the reported data discrepancies in the literature.

However, one of the main drawbacks encountered in implementing it is its resultant high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

The problem with these, however, is that their effects on other parameters are not always positive. These effects include a decrease in the bit error rate (BER), an increase in complexity, or a reduction in the bit rate. The objective of this paper is to describe the PAPR problem in a bid to reduce the peaks in the OFDM signal. The paper proposes a classification, performance evaluation and optimization of PAPR reduction techniques for commercial, public safety, and tactical applications.

Methods: Using images from CT and MRI, this paper reviews the indications for liver segmentation, technical approaches used in segmentation software and the developing roles of liver segmentation in clinical practice. Results: Liver segmentation for volumetric assessment is indicated prior to major hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and transplant.

Hence, reviews are valuable not only to users who would like to find out what others think about an app, but also to developers and software companies interested in customer feedback. The rapid increase in the number of applications and total app store revenue has accelerated app store data mining and opinion aggregation studies. While development companies and app store regulators have pursued upfront opinion mining studies for business intelligence and marketing purposes, research interest into app ecosystem and user reviews is relatively new. In addition to studies examining online product reviews, there are now some academic studies focused on mobile app stores and user reviews. The objectives of this systematic literature review are to identify proposed solutions for mining online opinions in app store user reviews, challenges and unsolved problems in the domain, any new contributions to software requirements evolution and future research direction. © 2016\", 'Customer satisfaction; Data mining; Fixed platforms; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Requirements engineering; Future research directions; Mobile applications; Online product reviews; Opinion mining; Research interests; Software requirements; Systematic literature review; Unsolved problems; Application programs', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85003875563&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2016.11.027&partnerID=40&md5=320e0bd738a694513c6444018a983816', ['literature review', 3, 'review match']]\n",

To assess these impacts, rainfall data from climate models are commonly used. The main goal of this paper is to report on the state of knowledge and recent works on the study of CC impacts with a focus on urban areas, in order to produce an integrated review of various approaches to which future studies can then be compared or constructed. Model output statistics (MOS) methods are increasingly used in the literature to study the impacts of CC in urban settings. A review of previous works highlights the non-stationarity nature of future climate data, underscoring the need to revise urban drainage system design criteria. A comparison of these studies is made difficult, however, by the numerous sources of uncertainty arising from a plethora of assumptions, scenarios, and modeling options. All the methods used do, however, predict increased extreme precipitation in the future, suggesting potential risks of combined sewer overflow frequencies, flooding, and back-up in existing sewer systems in urban areas. Future studies must quantify more accurately the different sources of uncertainty by improving downscaling and correction methods. New research is necessary to improve the data validation process, an aspect that is seldom reported in the literature.

Consequently, the task of high-level IoT applications to interpret such data and detect events in the real world is more complex. Moreover, data heterogeneity leads to the lack of interoperability between IoT applications. Semantic Web (SW) technologies have been widely adopted to model and integrate data from different sources on the web; extending them to the IoT domain can be used to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Semantically annotating IoT data is a fundamental step toward developing smarter and interoperable IoT applications. However, this type of process requires a large amount of computing resources, especially in scenarios where a large number of sensors is expected to be involved such as smart city. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight semantic annotation approach that can be implemented on resource-constrained IoT gateways connected to a limited number of sensors. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have carried out a set of experimentations using a middleware prototype implementation.

FSO communication uses optical carrier in the near infrared band to establish either terrestrial links within the Earth's atmosphere or inter-satellite/deep space links or ground-to-satellite/satellite-to-ground links. It also finds its applications in remote sensing, radio astronomy, military, disaster recovery, last mile access, backhaul for wireless cellular networks, and many more.

Out of these three effects, the atmospheric turbulence is a major challenge that may lead to serious degradation in the bit error rate performance of the system and make the communication link infeasible.

The subject of dendritic growth has received much attention from both scientific and industrial points of view. On the one hand, dendritic growth has become a deeply investigated subject in non-linear dynamics field. On the other hand, its understanding became essential for some engineering applications, mainly in metallurgy and latent thermal energy storage where phase change materials are used. Therefore, understanding and modeling the mechanisms which result the dendritic structures has been the objective of much research over the last decades. In order to understand the formation of dendrites, it is essential to understand the physical mechanisms on the interface separating the two phases. This paper reviews and discusses the available theories of dendritic growth, and then introduces the Gibbs-Thomson condition which has to be taken into account to handle all interfacial effects. Based on the Gibbs-Thomson condition, a complete mathematical model describing the dendritic growth problem for pure substances is formulated. This model includes the heat equation in both liquid and solid phases, the heat conservation equation at the interface separating these two phases, and the proposed Gibbs-Thomson equation.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to propose and evaluate a new technique to assess bone mineral density of fractured vertebrae using quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Overview of Literature: There is no available technique to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) at the fractured vertebra because of the alterations in bony structures at the fracture site. Methods: Forty patients with isolated fracture from T10 to L2 were analyzed from the vertebrae above and below the fracture level. Apparent density (AD) was measured based on the relationship between QCT images attenuation coefficients and the density of calibration objects. AD of 8 independent regions of interest (ROI) within the vertebral body and 2 ROI within the pedicles of vertebrae above and below the fractured vertebra were measured. At the level of the fractured vertebra, AD was measured at the pedicles, which are typically intact. AD of the fractured vertebral body was linearly interpolated, based on the assumption that AD at the fractured vertebra is equivalent to the average AD measured in vertebrae adjacent to the fracture. Estimated and measured AD of the pedicles at the fractured level were compared to verify our assumption of linear interpolation from adjacent vertebrae. Results: The difference between the measured and the interpolated density of the pedicles at the fractured vertebra was 0.006 and 0.003 g/cm3 for right and left pedicle respectively. The highest mean AD located at the pedicles and the lowest mean AD was found at the anterior ROI of the vertebral body. Significant negative correlation exist between age and AD of ROI in the vertebral body. Conclusions: This study suggests that the proposed technique is adequate to estimate the AD of a fractured vertebra from the density of adjacent vertebrae. © 2017 by Korean Society of Spine Surgery.', '', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015171506&doi=10.4184%2fasj.2017.11.1.57&partnerID=40&md5=47c4c84be249814273841033f54ed64e', ['Overview', 1]]\n",

Engineering such safety-critical software is not straightforward as authorities impose stringent regulation like DO-178. Besides, the more functions the software has to provide, the more complex it becomes. Thus, effective engineering methods are required. In this context, DO-178C now considers contemporary software development techniques like Model-Driven Engineering. In particular Model-Driven Engineering has gained interest as a cost-and time-effective alternative reducing software development complexities by enabling reasoning at the model level. In this paper we present a review of a set of model-based approaches to assess their support for software development and certification under DO-178C. We built a framework to characterize these approaches according with several criteria, specially coverage of DO-178C's required information for compliance. We analyze the approaches using this framework and highlight their commonalities, differences, strengths and weaknesses.

The visual review of HFOs on intracerebral electroencephalography is time consuming and tedious, and it can be improved by time-frequency (TF) analysis. The main issue is that the signal is dominated by lower frequencies that mask the HFOs. Our aim was to flatten (i.e., whiten) the frequency spectrum to enhance the fast oscillations while preserving an optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR). Method: We investigated eight methods of data whitening based on either prewhitening or TF normalization in order to improve the detectability of HFOs. We detected all local maxima of the TF image above a range of thresholds in the HFO band. Results: We obtained the precision and recall curves at different SNR and for different HFO types and illustrate the added value of whitening both in the TF plane and in time domain. Conclusion: The normalization strategies based on a baseline and on our proposed method (the 'H 0 z-score') are more precise than the others. Significance: The H 0 z-score provides an optimal framework for representing and detecting HFOs, independent of a baseline and a priori frequency bands. © 2016 IEEE.\", 'Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Frequency bands; Heart valve prostheses; Time domain analysis; Wavelet transforms; Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Normalization strategies; Optimal frameworks; Precision and recall; stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG); Time frequency analysis; whitening; Signal to noise ratio; analysis; area under the curve; Article; brain function; electroencephalogram; high frequency oscillation; human; signal noise ratio; stereoelectroencephalography; time; time frequency analysis; brain cortex; computer simulation; electroencephalography; epilepsy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; signal processing; Cerebral Cortex; Computer Simulation; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999085053&doi=10.1109%2fTBME.2016.2556425&partnerID=40&md5=3b98f0493b39b3b978402fb4dfdd95d1', ['review match']]\n",

On the surface of the planet, nowhere is this more immediate and important than with the terrestrial power grid, which is responsible for delivering electrical power to much of the planets population.

The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the structured deliberation and the following analysis to formulate a combination of assessment parameters for solar thermal power technologies based on data providers' judgment. A generic value tree of evaluation parameters is therefore obtained for solar thermal power technologies in developing countries. Expert elicitation was conducted through the Delphi method, with a total of 140 data providers from multidisciplinary solar thermal power fields affiliated in educational institutes, research centers, governmental organizations, and industrial companies from 32 countries participating in the survey. Five impact categories and nineteen performance measures were combined following a comprehensive literature review to derive a preliminary value tree.

The purpose of this review is to analyze EEE techniques from six viewpoints: single models used to construct ensembles, ensemble estimation accuracy, rules used to combine single estimates, accuracy comparison of EEE techniques with single models, accuracy comparison between EEE techniques and methodologies used to construct ensemble methods. We performed a systematic review of EEE studies published between 2000 and 2016, and we selected 24 of them to address the questions raised in this review. We found that EEE techniques may be separated into two types: homogeneous and heterogeneous, and that the machine learning single models are the most frequently employed in constructing EEE techniques. We also found that EEE techniques usually yield acceptable estimation accuracy, and in fact are more accurate than single models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We examine different kinds of changes including changes in the interfaces, implementation, and exception handling. For user-related factors, we leverage the number of app's downloads and installations, and users' reviews.

Accidents during maintenance activities are frequent, sometimes fatal and often associated with deficient or absent machinery lockout/tagout. Lockout/tagout is often circumvented in order to avoid what may be viewed as unnecessary delays and increased production costs. To reduce the dangers inherent in such practice, the purpose of this paper is to propose a production strategy that provides for machinery lockout/tagout while maximizing manufacturing system availability and minimizing costs. Design/methodology/approach - The joint optimization problem of production planning, maintenance and safety planning is formulated and studied using a stochastic optimal control methodology. Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations are developed and studied numerically using the Kushner approach based on finite difference approximation and an iterative policy improvement technique. Findings - The analysis leads to a solution that suggests increasing the comfortable inventory level in order to provide the time required for lockout/tagout activities. It is also demonstrated that the optimization of lockout/tagout procedures is particularly important when the equipment is relatively new and the inventory level is minimal. Research limitations/implications - This paper demonstrates that it is possible to integrate production, maintenance and lockout/tagout procedures into production planning while keeping manufacturing system cost objectives attainable as well as ensuring worker safety.

Materials and Methods This retrospective, internal review board-approved study was conducted in 35 patients with type 2 diabetes. Liver PDFF was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using a stimulated-echo acquisition mode sequence and MRI using a multiecho spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence at 3.0T. ROI sampling methods reported in the literature were reproduced and liver mean PDFF obtained by whole-liver segmentation was used as the reference standard. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Bland-Altman analysis, repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and paired t-tests were performed. Results ICC between MRS and MRI-PDFF was 0.916. Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent intermethod agreement with a bias of -1.5 ± 2.8%. The repeated-measures ANOVA found no systematic variation of PDFF among the nine liver segments. The correlation between liver mean PDFF and ROI sampling methods was very good to excellent (0.873 to 0.975). Paired t-tests revealed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) with ROI sampling methods that exclusively or predominantly sampled the right lobe. Significant correlations with mean PDFF were found with sampling methods that included higher number of segments, total area equal or larger than 5 cm2, or sampled both lobes (P = 0.001, 0.023, and 0.002, respectively). Conclusion MRI-PDFF quantification methods should sample each liver segment in both lobes and include a total surface area equal or larger than 5 cm2 to provide a close estimate of the liver mean PDFF. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; female; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; liver lobe; liver mean proton density fat fraction; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; procedures, parameters and devices; randomized controlled trial (topic); region of interest; retrospective study; sampling; whole liver segmentation; adipose tissue; analysis of variance; animal; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; liver; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observer variation; pathology; rat; standard; young adult; biological marker; proton; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biomarkers; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Observer Variation; Protons; Rats; Reference Standards; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963828939&doi=10.1002%2fjmri.25083&partnerID=40&md5=de0b137afcf74f929f336f214e57c3c5', ['review match']]\n",

In that context, in this paper, we address the problem of an unreliable manufacturing system producing one product family type to meet a demand. We consider that the manufacturing system’s operations generate harmful emissions into the environment. Hence, in addition to inventory, production and backlog costs, an environmental penalty is imposed when the emission level reaches a specific limit (cap approach). Because technology investments in production clean processes is often heavy and to improve its environmental strategy, we consider that demand can be partially satisfied by an unreliable subcontractor. The subcontractor which is characterized by a high development and innovation on sustainable technology requires a high selling cost and a random availability. This work examines this decision-making problem in order to propose a new joint production and subcontracting control policy which takes into account the emission level. The objective is to optimize the total cost, which includes the inventory, backlog, production, emission, and subcontracting costs, over an infinite horizon. An experimental approach combining simulation, experimental design and response surface methodology is used to solve the problem. Through numerical examples and further sensitivity analysis, the structure of the control policy is confirmed and analyzed.

Biomass pyrolysis represents a key step to numerous valorisation options and it is characterized by differential output products that are determined by the operating conditions of the process and the characteristics of the input. However, when used to valorise plants that have undergone significant metal uptake, this strategy involves some new aspects related to harvest, procedure and final product reutilization.

Early studies suffered methodological caveats leading to overoptimistic results and lack of statistical significance. The publication of guidelines addressing mainly the question of performance evaluation and statistical validation in seizure prediction helped revising the status of the field. While many studies failed to prove that above chance prediction is possible by applying these guidelines, other studies were successful. Methods based on EEG analysis using linear and nonlinear measures were reportedly successful in detecting preictal changes and using them to predict seizures above chance. In this review, we present a selection of studies in seizure prediction published in the last decade. The studies were selected based on the validity of the methods and the statistical significance of performance results. These results varied between studies and many showed acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity that could be appealing for therapeutic devices. The relatively large prediction horizon and early preictal changes reported in most studies suggest that seizure prediction may work better in closed loop seizure control devices rather than as seizure advisory devices. The emergence of a large database of annotated long-term EEG recordings should help prospective assessment of prediction methods.

Thus, several recent studies, including ours, pointed out that CNTs have cytotoxic effects on human and animal cells, which occur via the alteration of key regulator genes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival, cell–cell adhesion, and angiogenesis. Meanwhile, few investigations revealed that CNTs could also be harmful to the normal development of the embryo.

However, their numerical simulations pose several challenges to the scientific community. One of these challenge is the prediction of the trajectory of the ice piece removed from aircraft critical surfaces. Although the ice motion equations are simple to solve, they are highly sensitive to initial values. It is thus extremely dificult to validate the numerical simulation of a trajectory by comparaison to experimental trajectories without taking into account the randomness of the initial condition. The randomness of the simulation are often taken into account by Monte Carlo method, but without a clear criteria to select the required number of sample needed to obtain a statistically valid mean and variance. The goal of this paper is to propose a relation to estimate the number of Monte Carlo sample needed for a given error. First a brief literature review presents the previous work related to ice trajectory prediction. Second, the Lagrangian mathematical model, including Magnus effect, and the Monte Carlo method are detailed.

The aluminium scraps that can be recycled include cans and machining chips. The machining processes produce chips of various sizes and shapes, wet or dry, oxidised or not, depending on type of process and the machining conditions, parameters and tools used. Some processes produce metallic dusts and fine chips while other produce large or medium size chips. In some industries such as mould making and aeronautic industries, the chip removal can easily represent 80% of the initial workpiece mass. The type of chips produced during machining can have a great impact on chip management, on part quality, on machine and tool reliability and on part manufacturing costs. The machining chips can be recycled using casting, sintering or pressing and extrusion processes depending on the goal targeted. The selection of the recycling process must take into account the targeted applications, the chip (composition, sizes and cleanliness) and its mechanical properties. Depending on the nature of process to be used and the machining chip generation conditions, some treatments might be necessary prior to transportation and recycling.

Although tremendous progress has been made in the field of acoustic communication underwater, however, it is limited by bandwidth. All this has led to the proliferation of underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC), as it provides higher data rates than the traditional acoustic communication systems with significantly lower power consumption and simpler computational complexities for short-range wireless links. UOWC has many potential applications ranging from deep oceans to coastal waters. However, the biggest challenge for underwater wireless communication originates from the fundamental characteristics of ocean or sea water; addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of complex physio-chemical biological systems. In this paper, the main focus is to understand the feasibility and the reliability of high data rate underwater optical links due to various propagation phenomena that impact the performance of the system. This paper provides an exhaustive overview of recent advances in UOWC. Channel characterization, modulation schemes, coding techniques, and various sources of noise which are specific to UOWC are discussed.

This explains why gait analysis is important and increasingly used nowadays for the diagnosis of many different types (neurological, muscular, orthopedic, etc.) of diseases. This paper introduces a novel method to quickly visualize the different parts of the body related to an asymmetric movement in the human gait of a patient for daily clinical usage. The proposed gait analysis algorithm relies on the fact that the healthy walk has (temporally shift-invariant) symmetry properties in the coronal plane. The goal is to provide an inexpensive and easy-to-use method, exploiting an affordable consumer depth sensor, the Kinect, to measure the gait asymmetry and display results in a perceptual way. Method: We propose a multi-dimensional scaling mapping using a temporally shift invariant distance, allowing us to efficiently visualize (in terms of perceptual color difference) the asymmetric body parts of the gait cycle of a subject. We also propose an index computed from this map and which quantifies locally and globally the degree of asymmetry. Results: The proposed index is proved to be statistically significant and this new, inexpensive, marker-less, non-invasive, easy to set up, gait analysis system offers a readable and flexible tool for clinicians to analyze gait characteristics and to provide a fast diagnostic. Conclusion: This system, which estimates a perceptual color map providing a quick overview of asymmetry existing in the gait cycle of a subject, can be easily exploited for disease progression, recovery cues from post-operative surgery (e.g., to check the healing process or the effect of a treatment or a prosthesis) or might be used for other pathologies where gait asymmetry might be a symptom. © 2015 Moevus et al.', 'Color; Colorimetry; Diagnosis; Musculoskeletal system; Neurology; Pathology; Color map; Depth Map; Depth sensors; Locomotor disorders; Multi-dimensional scaling; Temporal shifts; Gait analysis; algorithm; Article; controlled study; diagnostic test; disease course; gait; gait symmetry; healing; human; image processing; imaging and display; motion analysis system; multidimensional scaling; perceptual color map; postoperative care; priority journal; sensor; treadmill ergometry; adult; diseases; economics; female; male; physical examination; procedures; Adult; Algorithms; Disease; Female; Gait; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Physical Examination', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945925284&doi=10.1186%2fs12938-015-0097-2&partnerID=40&md5=f6de57c9ec249618e1eee0c6354c6bc7', ['overview', 1]]\n",

Materials and Methods: This retrospective, institutional review board-approved study was conducted in 41 subjects who underwent liver CT for preoperative planning. The major pathologies encountered were colorectal cancer metastases, benign liver lesions and hepatocellular carcinoma. This semiautomated segmentation method is based on variational interpolation and 3D minimal path-surface segmentation. Total and subsegmental liver volumes were segmented from contrast-enhanced CT images in venous phase. Two image analysts independently performed semiautomated segmentations and two other image analysts performed manual segmentations. Repeatability and agreement of both methods were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. Interaction time was recorded for both methods. Results: Bland-Altman analysis revealed an intrareader agreement of -1 ± 27 mL (mean ± 1.96 standard deviation) with ICC of 0.999 (P < 001) for manual segmentation and 12 ± 97 mL with ICC of 0.991 (P < 001) for semiautomated segmentation. Bland-Altman analysis revealed an interreader agreement of -4 ± 22 mL with ICC of 0.999 (P < 001) for manual segmentation and 5 ± 98 mL with ICC of 0.991 (P < 001) for semiautomated segmentation. Intermethod agreement was found to be 3 ± 120 mL with ICC of 0.988 (P < 001). Mean interaction time was 34.3 ± 16.7 minutes for the manual method and 8.0 ± 1.2 minutes for the semiautomated method (P < 001). Conclusions: A semiautomated segmentation method can substantially shorten interaction time while preserving a high repeatability and agreement with manual segmentation. © 2015 AUR.', 'adult; Article; automation; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; human; image reconstruction; institutional review; intermethod comparison; liver cell carcinoma; liver injury; liver weight; male; metastatic colorectal cancer; multidetector computed tomography; priority journal; retrospective study; semiautomated liver segmentation; validation study; volumetry; aged; anatomic landmark; colorectal tumor; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; image processing; intravenous drug administration; liver; liver resection; liver tumor; middle aged; observer variation; organ size; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; secondary; standards; statistics and numerical data; three dimensional imaging; contrast medium; iopamidol; Adult; Aged; Anatomic Landmarks; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Colorectal Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Female; Hepatectomy; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Injections, Intravenous; Iopamidol; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Observer Variation; Organ Size; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938741377&doi=10.1016%2fj.acra.2015.03.010&partnerID=40&md5=4abc4415abd1c8a507b6ce20f40921e3', ['review match']]\n",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide support for mining industry managers who are required to reconcile equipment choices with OHS and productivity. METHODS: Examination of the literature through interdisciplinary digital databases. Databases were searched using specific combinations of keywords and limited to studies dating back no farther than 1992. The \"snowball\" technique was also used to examining the references listed in research articles initially identified with the databases. RESULTS: A total of 19 contextual factors were identified as having the potential to influence the OHS and productivity leverage of equipment innovations. The most often cited among these factors are the level of training provided to the equipment operators, operator experience and age, supervisor leadership abilities, and maintaining good relations within work crews. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between these factors are not discussed in mining innovation literature.

Decision trees and rule-based algorithms have demonstrated their potential to improve reliability of AIS classification because of their systematic approach and they have also been proposed in algorithms for selection of instrumentation levels in scoliosis. Our working hypothesis is that a rule-based algorithm with a knowledge base extracted from the literature can efficiently output surgical strategies alternatives for a given AIS case. Our objective is to develop a rule-based algorithm based on peer-reviewed literature to output alternative surgical strategies for approach and levels of fusion. Methods: A literature search of all English Manuscripts published between 2000 and December 2009 with Pubmed and Google scholar electronic search using the following keywords: “adolescent idiopathic scoliosis” and “surgery” alternatively with “levels of fusion” or “approach”. All returned abstracts were screened for contents that could contain rules to include in the knowledge base. A dataset of 1,556 AIS cases treated surgically was used to test the surgical strategy rule-based algorithm (SSRBA) and evaluate how many surgical treatments are covered by the algorithm. The SSRBA was programmed using Matlab. Descriptive statistic was used to evaluate the ability of the rule-based algorithm to cover all treatment alternatives. Results: A SSRBA was successfully developed following Lenke classification’s concept that the spine is divided into three curve segments [proximal thoracic (PT), main thoracic (MT) and thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL)]. Each of the 1,556 AIS patients in the dataset was ran through the SSRBA. It proposed an average of 3.78 (±2.06) surgical strategies per case. Overall, the SSRBA is able to match the treatment offered by the surgeon in approach and level of fusion 70\\xa0% of the time (with one vertebral level leeway). Conclusion: This study is to the author’s knowledge the first attempt at proposing an algorithm to output all surgical alternatives for a given AIS case. It uses a rule-based algorithm with a knowledge base extracted from peer-reviewed literature in an area with great variability. When tested against a database of AIS patients treated surgically, the SSRBA developed has the ability to propose a surgical plan with respect to approach and levels of fusion that match the surgeon’s plan in a great majority of cases. Since this SSRBA seems to output multiple valid surgical strategies, it could allow the comparisons of various strategies and the outcomes achieved in similar cases in large databases for a given case and guide surgical treatment. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.', 'adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; algorithm; anterior spine fusion; Article; clinical classification; clinical decision making; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; Cobb angle; human; knowledge base; kyphosis; lumbar vertebra; lung function; musculoskeletal system parameters; outcome assessment; patient compliance; postoperative complication; priority journal; risk factor; spine radiography; spine surgery; surgical approach; surgical strategy rule based algorithm; surgical technique; systematic review; thoracic spine; thoracolumbar spine; treatment planning; classification; decision support system; female; information processing; male; scoliosis; spine fusion; Adolescent; Algorithms; Datasets as Topic; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Male; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84933178217&doi=10.1007%2fs00586-014-3736-6&partnerID=40&md5=e5c98200396d51b98d9de4f953c870ba', ['systematic review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

High-quality mechanical parts include those with better surface finish and texture, dimension and form accuracies, reduced residual stress and burr-free. Burr formation is one of the most common and undesirable phenomenon occurring in machining operations, which reduces assembly and machined part quality. To remove burrs, a secondary operation known as deburring is required for post-processing and edge finishing operations. Since deburring is costly and considered a non-value-added process, the goal is desired to eliminate burrs or reduce the effort required to remove them. Because of non-uniform chip thickness, tool runout and complex interactive effects between cutting process parameters, milling burr formation is a very complex mechanism. Therefore, research and close attention are still needed in order to minimize and control milling burr formation.

All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW.

This timely book comprehensively identifies, classifies, analyses and quantifies all associated power quality problems, including the direct integration of renewable energy sources in the distribution system, and systematically delivers mitigation techniques to overcome these problems. Key features: • Emphasis on in-depth learning of the latest topics in power quality extensively illustrated with waveforms and phasor diagrams. • Essential theory supported by solved numerical examples, review questions, and unsolved numerical problems to reinforce understanding. • Companion website contains solutions to unsolved numerical problems, providing hands-on experience. Senior undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering students and instructors will find this an invaluable resource for education in the field of power quality. It will also support continuing professional development for practicing engineers in distribution and transmission system operators. © 2015 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.

However, existing systematic map and review studies on software development effort prediction have not investigated in depth several issues of ASEE techniques, to the exception of comparisons with other types of estimation techniques. Objective: The objective of this research is twofold: (1) to classify ASEE studies which primary goal is to propose new or modified ASEE techniques according to five criteria: research approach, contribution type, techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE steps, as well as identifying publication channels and trends and (2) to analyze these studies from five perspectives: estimation accuracy, accuracy comparison, estimation context, impact of the techniques used in combination with ASEE methods, and ASEE tools. Method: We performed a systematic mapping of studies for which the primary goal is to develop or to improve ASEE techniques published in the period 1990-2012, and reviewed them based on an automated search of four electronic databases. Results: In total, we identified 65 studies published between 1990 and 2012, and classified them based on our predefined classification criteria. The mapping study revealed that most researchers focus on addressing problems related to the first step of an ASEE process, that is, feature and case subset selection. The results of our detailed analysis show that ASEE methods outperform the eight techniques with which they were compared, and tend to yield acceptable results especially when combining ASEE techniques with Fuzzy Logic (FL) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, the use of other techniques such FL and GA in combination with an ASEE method is promising to generate more accurate estimates. However, the use of ASEE techniques by practitioners is still limited: developing more ASEE tools may facilitate the application of these techniques and then lead to increasing the use of ASEE techniques in industry. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A key advantage of time-mode ΔΣ converters is that they are realized using digital circuits and process information in the form of time-difference intervals. As a consequence of using digital circuits, this technique benefits from low voltage operation without concern for reduced signal swings, sensitivities to thermal noise effects, or switching noise sensitivity. Recently, several studies on time-mode ΔΣ converters have been conducted showing that such methodology has high potential in low-voltage design. The noise-shaping behavior demonstrated by this technique can be implemented and extended in various ways, including voltage-controlled delay unit (VCDU) or gated-ring oscillator (GRO)-based implementations of TMΔΣ converters.

Although comprising only a small fraction of Earth's cryosphere, the net mass loss of mountain glaciers worldwide has become one of the most widely recognized indicators of the reality of human-induced climate change. And since freshwater is essential for human society, there is a critical link between the fate of glaciers and sustainability of water resources downstream. However, it is not accurate to assume retreating glaciers comprise a generalizable water shortage to society. Many variables relating to location, watershed scale, and timing (of both seasonal availability and demand) impact glacier water resources, and present challenges for models used to project future scenarios. Assessing the relative magnitude of glacier influence on water resources requires not only careful assessments of climate control and hydrologic response, but also a critical review of the social factors that ultimately hold sway over water allocation and access [1]. The key conditions necessary for glacier formation are possible at nearly all latitudes (Figure 11.1), while regional differences in climate and proximity to human society impact the supply and exploitation of glacier water. In general, mountain topography constrains the nature of glacier water resources, from modifying climate required to sustain glaciers, to influencing all surface and subsurface flow and reservoirs. Glaciers are effective “water towers” [2], accumulating seasonal snow and ice above the snowline, while also releasing freshwater as the ice flows downward and melts. The gravitational potential energy yields secondary resource gains as water flowing from mountain regions is often utilized for hydroelectrical power generation. Nevertheless, human demands for water vary regionally and impact risks to water resources. With ongoing global climate change, glacier water resources are vulnerable to a high degree of climate sensitivity. Studies of warming climate scenarios mostly feature glacier recession that will alter the volume and variability of stream flow. The hydrological response to glacier retreat follows a characteristic sequence for regions undergoing net glacier mass loss. Under conditions of continuous retreat, glaciers generate a temporary increase in glacial-melt-derived stream runoff as they lose mass. As the remaining glacier volume diminishes, the annual runoff hydrograph reaches a maximum called “peak water” and is then followed by a persistent annual decrease [3]. © Cambridge University Press 2015.\", '', 'Book Chapter', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953216603&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9781107588653.011&partnerID=40&md5=1d52f02fd0be0b7844c40610373efacd', ['critical review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

To this end, a UML profile has been developed for the specification of security hardening aspects on UML diagrams. In addition, a weaving framework, with the underlying theoretical foundations, has been designed for the systematic injection of security aspects into UML models. The work is organized as follows: chapter 1 presents an introduction to software security, model-driven engineering, UML and aspect-oriented technologies. Chapters 2 and 3 provide an overview of UML language and the main concepts of aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) respectively. Chapter 4 explores the area of model-driven architecture with a focus on model transformations. The main approaches that are adopted in the literature for security specification and hardening are presented in chapter 5. After these more general presentations, chapter 6 introduces the AOM profile for security aspects specification. Afterwards, chapter 7 details the design and the implementation of the security weaving framework, including several real-life case studies to illustrate its applicability. Chapter 8 elaborates an operational semantics for the matching/weaving processes in activity diagrams, while chapters 9 and 10 present a denotational semantics for aspect matching and weaving in executable models following a continuation-passing style.

However, accurate measurement of GT displacement remains a problem with errors up to 13 mm on plain radiography (XR). A new GT ratio for measuring fracture displacement on XR is described, validated, and correlated with computed tomography (CT) and surgical decision making. Methods: A retrospective review of shoulder radiographs was performed from 2007 to 2010 to identify all cases of isolated GT fractures with both XR and CT. The GT ratio was performed on all XR and correlated with superior GT displacement measured on CT. The GT ratio was then tested for accuracy of surgical decision using 5mm superior displacement on CT as the cutoff. Finally, the inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the GT ratio were calculated and compared with the Neer and Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classifications. Results: Forty cases of acute GT fractures with XR and CT were identified. The GT ratio correlated very well with superior displacement on CT (Pearson correlation = 0.852, P < 0.01) and accurately classified GT fractures as \"surgical\" (n = 9, 23%) or \"nonsurgical\" (n = 31, 77%). GT ratios ≤0.00 were nonsurgical, ≥0.50 were surgical, and 0.00-0.50 warranted further imaging (P < 0.01). The GT ratio performed as well as or better than the AO and Neer classifications for inter- and intraobserver reliabilities. Conclusions: The GT ratio described in this study correlates very well with CT for superior GT fracture displacement. It involves significantly less radiation and accurately classifies GT fractures as nonsurgical (ratio < 0.00), surgical (ratio > 0.50), or as benefiting from further imaging (0.00-0.50). It performs as well or better than the Neer or AO classification.

A factor influencing this issue is, generally, lack of recognition of the benefits of establishing ergonomic principles within most occupational activities. Recent progress to move occupational health practice toward a more preventive approach has been conducted, frequently with international support. The introduction of a set of Cuban standards proposing the necessity of ergonomic evaluations is an example of this progress. The main challenge for Cuban ergonomists is to transfer knowledge to occupational health practitioners in order to be in concordance with basic standards and regulations regarding ergonomics.

An electronic document search using key words and MeSH terms was performed with various databases. Two independent investigators were tasked with the screening of articles and quality assessment. A critical appraisal of what is known was performed and recommendations for clinical practice and future research were formulated. The database search yielded 61 references. One article on risk factors, three related to assessment tools, and two on interventions were retained. Age and previous work absence episodes were found to be risk factors of workplace disability. The Work Limitation Questionnaire, the Work Instability Scale for Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the Workplace Activity Limitations Scale were psychometrically sound for the population studied. Education-based interventions seem to be more effective than conventional interventions in helping individuals with knee OA return to work faster, reduce the number of days absent from work, and improve their overall well-being.

Some specific parameters will limit welding flaw dimensions in some or all direction based on the joint geometry, material and welding procedure. If discontinuities of critical size remain undetected, fatigue cracks might initiate and propagate in these zones because of dynamic in-service stresses leading to high repair costs and long down times. Therefore, reliable NDT methods and good knowledge of the probability of occurrence of welding flaws is important for fatigue life estimations. Every NDT method has its weaknesses; therefore, even after meticulous inspections it is likely for some discontinuities of critical sizes to remain in the welded joint.

Anaerobic digestion contributes to energy efficiency improvement but is limited by the biological process. A review has been conducted prior to experimentation in order to evaluate the mass and energy balances on anaerobic digestion followed by gasification of digested sludge. The purpose was to improve energy recovery and reuse. Calculations were based on design parameters and tests that are conducted with the anaerobic digester of a local wastewater treatment plant and a small commercial gasification system. Results showed a very significant potential of energy recovery. More than 90% of the energy content from sludge was extracted. Also, approximately the same amount of energy would be transferred in both directions between the digester (biogas) and the gasifier (thermal energy). This extraction resulted in the same use of biogas as the reference scenario but final product was a totally dry biochar, which represented a fraction of the initial mass. Phosphorus was concentrated and significantly preserved. This analysis suggests that anaerobic digestion followed by dehydration, drying and gasification could be a promising and viable option for energy and nutrient recovery from municipal sludge in replacement of conventional paths. © The Author(s) 2014.', 'Biogas; Biosolids; Energy efficiency; Gasification; Nutrients; Recovery; Sewage sludge; Anaerobic digester; Biological process; Energy efficiency improvements; Mass and energy balance; Municipal sludge; Nutrient recovery; Wastewater sludge; Wastewater treatment plants; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; biogas; hydrogen sulfide; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; siloxane; volatile agent; biofuel; sewage; waste water; anaerobic digestion; article; dehydration; energy balance; energy consumption; energy recovery; energy transfer; environmental parameters; extraction; gasification; priority journal; recycling; sludge digestion; sludge drying; sludge treatment; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; anaerobic growth; analysis; bioreactor; procedures; sewage; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904790255&doi=10.1177%2f0734242X14538308&partnerID=40&md5=1f3713281fa91066ee9817473e65d8b5', ['review match']]\n",

In other knowledge fields, such as information systems (IS) and military research, the interoperability construct has evolved beyond the purely technological domain to encompass multiple dimensions. Within the AEC industry, these dimensions of interoperability have yet to take root. This paper introduces a conceptual framework that develops the interoperability construct across multiple dimensions. The framework defines emerging collaborative project delivery systems within the AEC industry by relating the technological, organization and procedural dimensions and situating them within the contextual dimension. The framework is underpinned by an information processing systems approach to project delivery in the AEC industry. Based on a two-part systematic literature review, a rigorous and structured process aimed at answering a very specific and targeted question within a given field, this paper presents the conceptual framework and discusses the various dimensions of interoperability. The paper concludes by presenting opportunities for future research through gaps identified in the literature.

In addition, a two-step analysis is applied to the results of the main methods reported in the literature, considering different classification problems. The first step is based on statistical analyses of the significance of these results. The idea is to figure out the problems for which a significant contribution can be observed in terms of classification performance by using a dynamic selection approach. The second step, based on data complexity measures, is used to investigate whether or not a relation exists between the possible performance contribution and the complexity of the classification problem. From this comprehensive study, we observed that, for some classification problems, the performance contribution of the dynamic selection approach is statistically significant when compared to that of a single-based classifier. In addition, we found evidence of a relation between the observed performance contribution and the complexity of the classification problem.

The best control policy in terms of cost will then be determined using a numerical example in the case of two identical product types and without the loss of generality of the problem. In the second part, two key performance indicators (KPIs): the cost and the customer satisfaction rate are simultaneously considered. The goal is to optimize the parameters of the policies studied, which minimize the total cost incurred while respecting customer satisfaction constraint. A discussion on the best control policy is conducted based on cost and customer satisfaction. An experimental resolution approach is used. It integrates combined discrete-continuous simulation models with statistical techniques of optimization such as design of experiments, analysis of variance, and response surface methodology. Finally, a discussion is conducted on the effects of other quantitative and qualitative criteria in order to determine the best control policy and to reach the best concerns of the company's decision makers.

Eight models with different levels of complexity are then selected to simulate daily precipitation for 35 stations across the world. All 8 models adequately reproduce the observed mean precipitation at daily, monthly and annual scales, while all of them underestimate the standard deviation of monthly and annual precipitation. However, the compound distributions are generally better than the single distributions at reducing the variance overdispersion, with the exception of the skewed normal (SN) distribution. The nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) is consistently better than all the parametric distributions. With the exception of the SN distribution, all the single distributions underestimate the upper tail of daily precipitation distribution. However, the generalized Pareto distribution-based compound distributions provide a reasonable performance for simulating the upper tail, even though they are slightly worse than the KDE, which displays the best performance. Overall, the compound distributions generally perform better than the single distributions, and the nonparametric KDE performs better than the parametric distributions. However, the complicated structure of the compound distribution and of the KDE and the limited extrapolation ability of the KDE may restrict their application to climate change impact studies.

Models themselves are most of time suspicious as they are often not tested in a very stringent or exhaustive way. In addition, it also appears that modeling parameters are somewhat too simplified to realistically describe the complete physics needed to predict the real life performance of PCMs added to a building. As a result, steps are now taken to create standard model benchmarks that will improve the confidence of the users. Hopefully, following these efforts, confidence will increase and usage of PCM in buildings should be eased. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\", 'Buildings; Mathematical models; Building applications; Journal paper; Material characterizations; Model parameters; Model validation; Real-life performance; Standard model; Thermal behaviors; Phase change materials; benchmarking; building; construction material; model validation; numerical model; performance assessment; phase transition', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883559630&doi=10.1016%2fj.renene.2012.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=82d8a392925ae1e4b835effa46099577', ['review match']]\n",

As grid and cloud computing have become a stringent demand for today¿s Internet services, IaaS is required for providing services, particularly ¿private cloud,¿ regardless of physical infrastructure locations.

Network control plane architecture plays therefore an essential role in this transition, particularly with respect to new requirements of scalability, reliability, and flexibility. In this article we review the evolutionary trend of network element control planes from monolithic to distributed architectures according to network growth, and then present a new virtualization oriented architecture that allows infrastructure providers and service providers to achieve service delivery independently and transparently to end users based on virtualized network control planes. As a result, current ISP infrastructures will be able to support new services, such as heavy resource consuming data center applications.

From a software perspective, that objective pushes developers to migrate toward safety critical space and time partitioning environment. However, mainstream commercial real-time operating systems (RTOS) offering such partitioning can be restrictive in early development due to very high licensing costs. That situation is even more striking when considering that low-cost alternatives could instead be used for system modeling and early simulation before acquisition of a target platform. This paper reviews existing low-cost and open-source development environments to propose a novel design flow. The proposed methodology starts with model-based analysis in the AADL modeling language. Then, configuration files and software integration code are generated and executed using the Simulated IMA (SIMA) software from GMV. A case study experiment was created using a Multi-purpose Control and Display Unit (MCDU) communicating with an external Flight Management System (FMS) simulation provided by our industrial partner CMC Electronics.

However, even the best fitness measure is often not precise enough to reveal the behavior of the optimizer's added features or the nature of the interactions among its parameters. This makes customization of an efficient search method a rather difficult task. The aim of this paper is to propose a diagnostic tool to help determine the impact of parameter setting by monitoring the exploration/ exploitation balance (EEB) of the search process, as this constitutes a key characteristic of any population-based optimizer. It is common practice to evaluate the EEB through a diversity measure. For any diagnostic tool developed to perform this function, it will be critical to be able to certify its reliability. To achieve this, the performance of the selected measure needs to be assessed, and the EEB framework must be able to accommodate any landscape structure. We show that to devise a diagnostic tool, the EEB must be viewed from an orthogonal perspective, which means that two diversity measures need to be involved: one for the exploration axis, and one for the exploitation axis. Exploration is best described by a genotypic diversity measure (GDM), while exploitation is better represented by a phenotypic convergence measure (PCM). Our paper includes a complete review of PCM formulations, and compares nearly all the published PCMs over a validation framework involving six test cases that offer controlled fitness distribution. This simple framework makes it possible to portray the underlying behavior of phenotypic formulations based on three established requirements: monotonicity in fitness varieties, twinning, and monotonicity in distance. We prove that these requirements are sufficient to identify phenotypic formulation weaknesses, and, from this conclusion, we propose a new PCM, which, once validated, is shown to comply with all the above-mentioned requirements. We then compare these phenotypic formulations over three specially designed fitness landscapes, and, finally, the new phenotypic formulation is combined with a genotypic formulation to form the foundation of the EEB diagnostic tool. The value of such a tool is substantiated through a comparison of the behaviors of various genetic operators and parameters.\", 'Evolutionary algorithms; Health; Diversity measure; Exploration exploitations; Exploration/exploitation; Genotypic diversity; Key characteristics; Landscape structures; Phenotypic diversity; Pre-mature convergences; Diagnostic products', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869483989&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2012.08.046&partnerID=40&md5=dcac4df722bca13431605a32cbe58439', ['complete review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

The results demonstrate that none of the available GDMs is able to reflect the true diversity of all search processes.

Also, although the morphology and mechanical properties of calcifications have been investigated, their effects on wall stresses remain controversial. Computational fluid dynamics usually assumes a rigid artery wall, whereas fluid-structure interaction accounts for artery compliance but is still challenging since arteries and blood have similar densities. We discuss alternatives to fluid-structure interaction based on dynamic medical images that address patient-specific hemodynamics and geometries.

Nevertheless, this claim could somehow be unsubstantiated. In this article, the authors try to shed some light on this issue by using the concept of energy return on investment (EROI) as a yardstick. This choice brings semantic issues because in this paper the EROI is used in a different context than that of energy production. Indeed, while watts and negawatts share the same physical unit, they are not the same object, which brings some ambiguities in the interpretation of EROI. These are cleared by a refined definition of EROI and an adapted nomenclature. This review studies the research in the energy efficiency of building operation, which is one of the most investigated topics in energy efficiency. This study focuses on the impact of insulation and high efficiency windows as means to exemplify the concepts that are introduced. These results were normalized for climate, life time of the building, and construction material. In many cases, energy efficiency measures imply a very high EROI.

Currently, the Lenke classification model is used for fusion region evaluation and surgical planning. Retrospective evaluation of Lenke classification and fusion region results was performed. Methods Using a database of 1,776 surgically treated AIS cases, we investigated a topologically ordered self organizing Kohonen network, trained using Cobb angle measurements, to determine the relationship between the Lenke class and the fusion region selection. Specifically, the purpose was twofold (1) produce two spatially matched maps, one of Lenke classes and the other of fusion regions, and (2) associate these two maps to determine where the Lenke classes correlate with the fused spine regions. Results Topologically ordered maps obtained using a multicenter database of surgically treated AIS cases, show that the recommended fusion region agrees with the Lenke class except near boundaries between Lenke map classes. Overall agreement was 88%. Conclusion The Lenke classification and fusion region agree in the majority of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis when reviewed retrospectively.

In hydraulic engineering, the objectives include the predictions of dam break waves\\' propagation, fluvial floods and other catastrophic flooding phenomenon, the modeling of estuarine and coastal circulations, and the design and optimization of hydraulic structures. Most of the flooding events involve wetting and drying lands which are critical for the numerical modeling, especially when dealing with complex topographies. Extreme slopes and abrupt changes in irregular geometries, have often led to significant numerical errors and stability difficulties, and these are more critical for propagations over complex dry beds. This paper presents a simple and efficient numerical model for the wetting and drying effects over complex bathymetries. An overview of the key methods that have been suggested since the pioneering studies is first presented. A 2-D cell-centered finite-volume scheme is then proposed for solving the shallow-water equations using both structured and unstructured fixed meshes. Steady state C-property and global mass conservation properties are satisfied using appropriate numerical fluxes and wet/dry interfaces treatments.

(2) The accuracy of 3D reconstruction obtained is better than that of 3D reconstruction from CT scan cuts. (3) The patient in addition gets imaged in a standing functional position, thanks to the AP and lateral X-rays obtained from head to feet simultaneously. This is a big advantage compared to CT scans which are used only in lying position. From the simultaneous AP and lateral X-rays of the whole body obtained via the 3D bone external envelop technique, the biomechanics engineers obtain 3D reconstruction of every level of osteo-articular system, especially for spine, in standing position with an acceptable period of time for reconstruction.

In this paper, a comprehensive review and synthesis of published experimental studies on the seismic rehabilitation of RC frame beam-column joints with FRP is presented, and the issues that need to be addressed for further research are discussed. In addition, the paper presents a simple design model for predicting the contribution of the FRP to the shear strength of retrofitted joints. The key element in the model is the derivation of an expression for the effective FRP strain, based on the calibration of test data reported in the literature. A total of 54 tests carried out worldwide were considered in the review, and a database of the published studies, encompassing all relevant design parameters, was assembled. The reported test results confirm the structural effectiveness of the FRP strengthening technique for the seismic retrofit of RC joints. However, there are some gaps which need to be addressed. For instance, there is a lack of a rationale explanation of the resistance mechanisms involved in the beam-column joints retrofitted with FRP. Such a rational explanation is a prerequisite for the development of more comprehensive and rigorous design procedure. © 2010 ASCE.', 'Beam columns; Concrete structures; Fiber reinforced polymers; Joints; Seismic effect; Beams and girders; Bridge decks; Building materials; Fiber reinforced plastics; Gene expression; Patient rehabilitation; Reinforced concrete; Reinforced plastics; Research; Retrofitting; Seismology; Shear strength; Structural design', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-75649150463&doi=10.1061%2f%28ASCE%29CC.1943-5614.0000049&partnerID=40&md5=89269f29b186b7119a4c7e6b41ef9899', ['comprehensive review', 1, 'review match']]\n",

Objective: This paper proposes a set of unified project management best practices by integrating and harmonizing on a high-level perspective PMBOK (4th ed.) processes and CMMI-DEV v1.2 specific practices of the basic project management process areas PP, PMC and SAM. Method: Based on the analysis of both models, a unified set of best practices has been defined by a group of researchers with theoretical and practical expertise on the CMMI framework and software process improvement as well as project management and the PMBOK. The proposed set has been revised by different researchers from different institutions in several review rounds until consensus was achieved. Results: As a result, a set of unified best practices is defined and explicitly mapped to the correspondent PMBOK processes and CMMI specific practices of the current versions of both models.

The control used for this purpose is real-power generation rescheduling, although any other control input could fit the new framework. The key performance metrics are the vulnerability index of a generation unit (VIGS) and its sensitivity (SVIGS), accurately computed using a realistic ac power flow incorporating the AGC model (AGC-PF). Transmission overloads, vulnerability indices and their sensitivities with respect to generation control are translated into fuzzy-set notations to formulate, transparently, the relationships between incremental line flows and the active power output of each controllable generator. A fuzzy-rule-based system is formed to select the best controllers, their movement and step-size, so as to minimize the overall vulnerability of the generating system while eliminating overflows. The controller performance is illustrated on the IEEE 39-bus (New England) network and the three-area IEEE-RTS96 network subjected to severe line outage contingencies. A key result is that minimizing the proposed vulnerability metric in real-time results in increased substantial loadability (prevention) in addition to overload elimination (correction). © 2009 IEEE.', 'Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy systems; Network performance; Structural loads; Automatic operator; Fuzzy logic control; Generation dispatch; Overload alleviation; Preventive/corrective security; Sensitivity factors; Vulnerability index; Fuzzy logic', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60149094353&doi=10.1109%2fTPWRS.2008.2008678&partnerID=40&md5=f0d401327ee5176e15b5427891fe7acf', ['overview', 1]]\n",

The high content of metal oxides in steel slags gives them a great potential to adsorb CO2, reaching a saturation value of about 0.25 kg of CO2/kg of slag. CO2 is physisorbed and chemisorbed on the most of metal oxide types. Generally, the CO2 physisorption on the basic and amphoteric metal oxides involves an electrostatic interaction between the CO2 and the cation from the oxides while the CO2 chemisorption rather implicates the basic sites that acts as the electron donor, and which are associated with O2- ions localized at surface defects. These interactions result in the formation of carbonates (monodentates or unidentates and bidentates). The affinity of oxides for the CO2 and the carbonate formation principally depend of the strength and number of basic sites at their surface and varies as following: basic oxides &gt; amphoteric oxides &gt; acidic oxides. The basic metal oxides generally represent the best electron donors and thus the best CO2 adsorbents due to the high basicity and their great number of reaction sites. Hence, it appears that the surface structure of basic and amphoteric metal oxides which may favour their interaction with the CO2, as well as their basicity is the determinant factor contributing to the formation of carbonate species. The molecular analysis of CO2 adsorption on steel slag metal oxides will provide useful data to identify rate-controlling mechanisms and should be considered for the development of new effective methods for the capture of atmospheric CO2 emissions released from industries. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Assuming that the duration of the music playback experience is really up to the user, the remaining parameter is the music playback level. The purpose of this study is to first understand - from the available public and scientific literature - what factors are influencing the PSP playback level; and second, to investigate if the use of earphones featuring good attenuation of the ambient noise level would lead to a reduced playback level, hence a reduced dose and eventually less auditory damage.

This paper begins by presenting a brief review of some of the main models for small particles diffusion. A general dynamic equation for aerosol transport is briefly discussed next. Since the particle diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of a friction coefficient, three relationships are then presented and their influences on the friction and diffusion coefficients are considered for the particular case of TiO2 nanoparticles. Although, all the models studied here predict a decrease in the value of the diffusion coefficient with increasing particle diameter, some significant variations can be observed between the models. A specific diffusion model, chosen between those studied, is finally applied to estimate the purge time of airborne TiO2 nanoparticles in a simple closed space the size of a glovebox.

However, the cost related to this type of mission is extremely steep. Recently, the satellite business has been revolutionized by the advent of small satellites and micro-satellites. Such spacecrafts now provide space mission opportunities with price tags several orders of magnitude below classical satellites. It is for this reason that the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has decided to investigate micro-planetary missions. The present work deals with mechanical design of a hopping robot prototype destined for the exploration of planets with a low gravitational environment (Mars for instance). This robot uses diurnal variations of temperature at Mars\\' surface as a source of power. An \"innovating\" cylindrical mechanism with scissors used to transfer the energy needed by the robot\\'s jump was designed, manufactured and tested. Moreover, an actuator with shape memory alloy (SMA) working with the sun\\'s heat was designed, while a prototype was tested. The robot\\'s design shows the following characteristics: a unique actuator is used to load the energy needed for the jump to torsion springs and to reposition the robot back on its feet after having hopped. The robot\\'s structure, in the shape of tetrahedron, is confined to a 300 mm edge length cubic envelope, which corresponds to a status of \"micro\" robot. The target mass for the entire system is 1-2 kg. The proposed concept takes advantage of the Martian environment. In fact, the low gravity and the low atmospheric density favor jumping as a means of locomotion, while the important gradient of temperature (day versus night) at the surface of Mars enables the elongation of the SMA. Consequently, jumping lets us cover longer distances while crossing the numerous rocks that cover the hazardous surface of Mars. This article, based on experimental development, presents an overview of the important elements of the preliminary mechanical design.

Concepts are tested in an aerospace case-study where CAD tools are used for modeling pockets in aircraft skin panels. Specific companies’ know-how can be modeled by CAD tools through either Customization or Automation. Customization is achieved by implementing the concepts through User-Defined Features (UDF). A UDF is seen as a specific aggregation of constraints established between lowlevel geometrical objects, so as to transform an imprint into a pseudo-imprint. Once defined, this aggregation of constraints is manipulated as a single entity to accelerate design work. Automation goes beyond customization by performing UDF instantiation with limited human intervention. Automation decomposes the typified high-level technical objects, such as an assembly, into a series of low-level technical objects that feed the UDF.

This and many other definitions of engineering put an emphasis on disciplined artifact creation as the essence of any engineering discipline. However, the material object produced by every engineering discipline is not necessarily of a similar nature. The case of software engineering is particularly relevant in the illustration of such differences, since software as an artifact is acknowledged as a very special piece of human work. The special nature of software was attributed by Brooks [7] to \"complexity\" as an essential characteristic. The following quote from Brooks paper illustrates the presupposed impact of complexity in the activities of engineering: Many of the classic problems of developing software products derive from this essential complexity and its nonlinear increases with size. From the complexity comes the difficulty of communication among team members, which leads to product flaws, cost overruns, and schedule delays. From the complexity comes the difficulty of enumerating, much less understanding, all the possible states of the program, and from that comes the unreliability. From complexity of function comes the difficulty of invoking function, which makes programs hard to use. From complexity of structure comes the difficulty of extending programs to new functions without creating side effects. From complexity of structure come the unvisualized states that constitute security trapdoors. The term \"essential\" (as opposed to \"accidental\") is a well-known tool for ontology engineers [17], which helps in determining the properties of concepts that objects possess \"always and in every possible world\". The position of Brooks on the essentials of the object of the discipline leads to a particular conception of software engineering as a human endeavour that attempts to tackle an inherently complex problem, since it takes as a point of departure the fact that complexity is a feature that cannot be removed from the engineering process. Consequently, it is difficult to consider methods that are definitive for the production of software, and the field is expected to change as methodologies are introduced and applied in an attempt to manage, to the extent possible, the complexity of the activities. This has a consequence on research and enquiry, since the qualities of a tool or method to tackle software complexity are difficult to assess, and this in turn leads to a plurality of approaches. Such diversity leads to difficulties in contrasting the appropriateness of techniques in terms of rational enquiry methods such as those established by Popper [12] in his method for scientific discovery. Empirical research on proposed software methods, processes, tools and techniques are of course fundamental to the discipline. In addition, ontology engineering is also important from our viewpoint for the evolution of the discipline of software engineering, at least in two dimensions. On the one hand, ontology may help in the organization and meta-analysis of empirical data and empirical approaches [6], facilitating an adequate comparison and evaluation of methods, techniques or tools. On the other hand, ontologies translated into machine-understandable representations may help in the development of computerized tools that, to some extent, take into account the purpose and consequences of the diverse software engineering activities. Even though we do not see ontologies as the \"silver bullet\" of every software production problem, they are promising tools to help in the work of researchers and practitioners, and they would also serve as an element of analysis and discussion for engineers and for learning about the discipline Consensus-reaching approaches to ontology engineering are deemed as appropriate for the crafting of representations of the concepts of some concrete domains. Nonetheless, in some domains the engineer can find pre-existing processes of consensus-reaching on conceptual frameworks. This is the case of software engineering, in which the SWEBOK project [1, 8] is the result of a considerable effort on the collaborative production of a subset of the knowledge of the discipline that is as of today subject to little controversy in the community of researchers. In addition to the collaborative effort, which will be briefly described next, the project adopts a literature- based approach [14] in selecting some relevant articles. Thus, the SWEBOK guide provides a ground of rationality and consensus that constitutes a valuable input for ontology engineering. The chapter by Ruiz and Hilera in this volume provides an overview of current approaches to the ontology of software engineering, some of them based on the SWEBOK. This chapter now concentrates on the specifics of two approaches to SWEBOK-based ontological enquiry that are complementary in their objectives and methods. The rest of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 3.2 provides an account of the SWEBOK as a project, its main principles and its method from creation to revision. Then, Sect. 3.3 describes some results of a process of enquiry on SWEBOK-based ontology from the viewpoint of the experimental study of the process of rational argument and consensusreaching by software engineers. Later on, Sect. 3.4 provides the complementary view of producing ontological representations linked to commonsense knowledge bases, analysing the benefits of reuse of existing ontological engineering and of being prepared for the construction of ontologybased tools. On the basis of the experiences described in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4, Sect. 3.5 sketches the main ontological elements distilled. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.', '', 'Book Chapter', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38049156052&doi=10.1007%2f3-540-34518-3_3&partnerID=40&md5=740ae95a40a099d1058dd9cf7f331031', ['overview', 1]]\n",

The authors introduce piezo-electric actuators in the experimental set-up that is used to accelerate the enzymatic molecular reaction in minute quantities of the reactant.

These enzymes are made to interact with their respective anti-bodies, whose reaction can be detected using many methods among which fluorescence spectroscopy is of preference and further detected using specific MEMS structures whose changes are detected through optical means. The results described here are intended to give a methodological approach to the creation of device in the future in the medical field for the detection of bio-molecules.

Next, a design of a motion/force controller for a constrained servo-robot, which is based on a commonly known modeling structure, is proposed. The contact between the end-effector and the environment is subject to frictional features. Accordingly, the control plant is based on the LuGre friction closed-loop observer. Therefore, new nonlinear position and force input transforms, which are slightly different from classical computed torques, are proposed, combined with a new change of variable. The main purpose of this paper is to establish the stability condition by using the passivity of interconnected linear and nonlinear subplants. From then on, because of this formulation, the authors succeed in designing a full-order dynamic position feedback and an integral force controller that ensure exponential stabilization within an H∞ multiobjective optimization. These conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The performances are experimentally validated on a two-degrees-of-freedom robot manipulator acting on a horizontal worktable with friction. The LuGre model estimator exhibits a richer behavior in terms of friction compensation and positioning tracking when experimentally compared to the Karnopp friction compensation.

It is for this reason that the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has decided to investigate micro planetary missions. The present work deals with mechanical design of a hopping robot prototype destined to the exploration of planets with a low gravitational environment (Mars for instance). This robot uses diurnal variations of temperature at Mars\\' surface as a source of power. An \"innovating\" cylindrical mechanism with scissors used to transfer the energy needed by the robot\\'s jump was designed, manufactured and tested. Moreover, an actuator with shape memory alloy (SMA\\'s) working with the sun\\'s heat was designed, while a prototype was tested. The robot\\'s design shows the following characteristics: a unique actuator is used to load the energy needed for the jump into torsion springs and to reposition the robot back on its feet after having hopped. The robot\\'s structure, in the shape of tetrahedron, is confined into a 300 mm edge length cubic envelope, which corresponds to a status of \"micro\" robot. The target mass for the entire system is in the order of 1-2 kg. The proposed concept takes advantage of the Martian environment. In fact, the low gravity and the low atmospheric density favour jumping as a means of locomotion, while the important gradient of temperature (day versus night) at the surface of Mars enables the elongation of the SMA. Consequently, jumping lets us cover longer distances while crossing the numerous rocks that cover the hazardous surface of Mars.

This difficulty increases when they have to take conflicting objectives into account. A recent review of the literature shows that previous works consider repairable systems subject to random failures and analyse trade-offs between the costs and the benefits of maintenance activities. The risk aversion of the maintenance decision maker may be not underlined enough. This paper aims to deal with a single component system that has to accomplish a series of missions of a given length. Design/methodology/approach - The development of a maintenance strategy for this system is analysed from a risk aversion point of view. An attempt is made to highlight the attitude of a neutral decision maker versus a risk-averse manager. Findings - Presents a very simple framework to analyse the risk aversion effect on managers' decisions. The model confirms the observation that risk aversion implies no-monotone relation between optimality frequencies of maintenance operations and the deformation rate of the breakdown probability. Originality/value - Since the deformation rate is monotonic with time, the proposed model can be extended to derive optimal frequencies, which allow the implementation of the optimal deformation rates according to the probability law of the deformation rate δ. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\", 'Costs; Decision making; Failure analysis; Integral equations; Probability; Production control; Random processes; Repair; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertain systems; Maintenance programs; Optimal frequencies; Repairable systems; Risk aversion point; Preventive maintenance', 'Review', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21144445388&doi=10.1108%2f13552510510601320&partnerID=40&md5=875ab52159d37c39026edbf3545c127c', ['review match']]\n",

The Gaussian model is appropriate when PSF values are positive, and the damped cosine model can account for negative values. These models are non-linear and fully two-dimensional and do not assume radial symmetry. The models were fitted to images of a point source. The models accounted for over 99% of the variance in the PSF signal. Errors in modulation transfer function were limited to 5% when the appropriate model was selected.

Following an overview of the essential features of ER fluids, this paper examines the different design details required in building an efficient ER car damper. This particular model, filled with a 'Rheobay VP AI3565' ER fluid, was experimentally tested for different speeds and under different electric fields. The experimental results obtained clearly show that, when the high electric field is turned on, the generated dissipative force, and hence the damping characteristics, could be greatly increased. The dynamics of this first ER damper prototype model were numerically analysed, with an emphasis placed on evaluation of the influence of the electrical field on the resulting dynamic response. The results show that the damping ability could be easily increased by increasing the height of the moving electrode. However, this damping increase, which increases the stiffness of the ER damper, should be handled carefully by both the designer and the user. Indeed, there is always an optimal damping value which provides a compromise between car stability and ride comfort. Moreover, the simulation shows that the controller used to control the damper should not only apply an on/off policy but should also be able to deliver a variable value of the applied high voltage. © 2003 TOP Publishing Ltd.\", 'Computer simulation; Electrodes; Energy dissipation; Intelligent materials; Rheology; Stiffness; Vehicle suspensions; Car dampers; Damping characteristics; Electro-rheological (ER) technology; Semi-active car suspensions; Damping', 'Article', 'Scopus', 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-23244450981&doi=10.1088%2f0964-1726%2f12%2f6%2f003&partnerID=40&md5=26e00a18114e9c80a8a6d2b3356867e2', ['overview', 1]]\n",

In two recent articles the authors have extended the application of the quadrature modeling structure to modeling broadband nonlinearities, which makes possible to predict harmonics and even-order nonlinearities, to take into account the frequency response, etc. This article completes the overview of the instantaneous quadrature technique. The authors discuss its application to modeling AM, FM and PM detectors, which are strongly nonlinear elements with large memory (both the strong nonlinearity and large memory effects are essential for the detector proper operation), thus removing the limitation of nonlinearity to be memoryless or quasimemoryless.

One of the world\\'s largest freshwater deltas, the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Canada, has experienced a series of wetting and drying cycles because of inter-annual variations in flooding. Recent research has found that most of the major floods affecting this system are produced by spring ice jams. For approximately two decades, however, the combination of climatic and flow-regulation effects precluded significant ice-jam flooding of the PAD. Resultant drying caused major changes to the ecology of the delta and led to the evaluation of a number of methods to restore water flows. Since most of delta is contained within a national park (Wood Buffalo National Park), a major goal was to employ non-structural measures. Hence, in an effort to manage the water problems of this delta, the final report of a multi-agency \"Northern River Basins Study\" made the recommendation that the spring flow-release strategy of the upstream hydro electric reservoir be modified to increase the probability of ice-jam flooding near the PAD. This was to be conducted in years when downstream hydrometeorological conditions (snowpack magnitude and ice-cover strength) appeared conducive to ice-jam formation. Such favourable conditions developed in the spring of 1996, a natural ice jam began to develop, and regulated flows were increased to assist in potential flooding. As a result, the PAD experienced its first major flood in over 20 years.

One is the labor-intensive nature of vision software development, which makes up most of the cost of a new application. The other is the lack of personnel competent in computer vision to set up applications. This situation is akin to that of expert systems before the advent of expert system shells, which largely solved these two problems for many applications. The development of software that would be to computer vision what expert system shells are to expert systems has been the subject of considerable enquiry over the last ten years: This paper reviews the pertinent publications and tries to present a coherent view of the field. We start by outlining two major differences between would be \"vision shells\" and conventional expert system shells. The first is the need for an intermediate level of symbolic representation between image pixels and the knowledge base. The second is that the mental operations that people perform to interpret images lie almost totally below the threshold of consciousness. Vision system designers therefore cannot, as domain experts normally do, examine their own mental processes and cast them into rules to extract information from images. The vision shell should thus contain, in addition to the usual knowledge engineering toolbox, knowledge on the pertinence of specific imaging operations towards various goals. After a review of the role of explicit knowledge in artificial vision, we examine the architecture a vision shell should have, and look at ways of facilitating the entry of domain-pertinent knowledge into it.

This complex pipeline workflow is a tedious process of iterative experimentation. Moreover, cloud computing services provide advanced features for managing ML stages and deploying them efficiently to production. Specifically, serverless computing has been applied in different stages of the machine learning pipeline. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is missing to know the serverless suitability and benefits it can provide to the ML pipeline. In this paper, we provide a systematic mapping study of machine learning systems applied on serverless architecture that include 53 relevant studies. During this study, we focused on (1) exploring the evolution trend and the main venues; (2) determining the researchers' focus and interest in using serverless on machine learning; (3) discussing solutions that serverless computing provides to machine learning. Our results show that serverless usage is growing, and several venues are interested in the topic. In addition, we found that the most widely used serverless provider is AWS Lambda, where the primary application was used in the deployment of the ML model. Additionally, several challenges were explored, such as reducing cost, resource scalability, and reducing latency. We also discuss the potential challenges of adopting ML on serverless, such as respecting service level agreement, the cold start problem, security, and privacy.

The main novelty of this paper is the development of a new decision-making method using the DEMATEL and Delphi techniques and the ANP. In this regard, first of all, data collection is performed through a literature review and survey studies using questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The applied method for experts' agreement was integrated through brainstorming and the classical Delphi method. By analyzing different economic, environmental, cultural, and social criteria using a hybrid decision-making framework, the results show that the main economic barrier with a weight of 0.2607 is ranked first, while the main feature of economic assessment is connected to the risk of investment. The cultural and social barriers, with a weight of 0.2258, ranked second, and the managerial barrier, with a weight of 0.2052, ranked third. In the social and managerial aspects, the main barriers were related to looking at green construction as luxurious and the uncertainty of green construction performance due to the climate and texture of the local area, respectively.

Ultrasonic inspection is commonly used in nondestructive testing to detect cracks and other defects.

However, casting of large size forged ingots introduces changes of mechanical parameters such as grain size, the Young's modulus, the Poisson's ratio, and the chemical composition. These heterogeneities affect the wave propagation, and consequently, the reliability of ultrasonic inspection and the imaging capabilities for these blocks.

Following a previous study that provided local mechanical parameters for a similar block, two-dimensional simulations were made to compute the optimal transducer parameters including the pitch, width and number of elements. It appeared that depending on the number of elements, backwall reconstruction can generate high amplitude artefacts. Indeed, the large dimensions of the simulated block introduce numerous constructive interferences from backwall reflections which may lead to important artefacts.

Seepage faces provide a direct and measurable groundwater flux but there is no existing method to quantitatively image groundwater processes at this boundary. Our objective is to determine the possibilities and limitations of thermal imagery in quantifying groundwater discharge from discrete seeps. We developed a conceptual model of temperature below discrete seeps, observed 20 seeps spectacularly exposed in three dimensions at an unused limestone quarry and conducted field experiments to examine the role of diurnal changes and rock face heterogeneity on thermal imagery. The conceptual model suggests that convective air-water heat exchange driven by temperature differences is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Thermal imagery is effective at locating and characterizing the flux of groundwater seeps. Areas of active groundwater flow and ice growth can be identified from thermal images in the winter, and seepage rates can be differentiated in the summer. However, the application of thermal imagery is limited by diverse factors including technical issues of image acquisition, diurnal changes in radiation and temperature, and rock face heterogeneity. Groundwater discharge rates could not be directly quantified from thermal imagery using our observations but our conceptual model and experiments suggest that thermal imagery could quantify groundwater discharge when there are large temperature differences, simple cliff faces, non-freezing conditions, and no solar radiation.', '', 'Article', 'WOS', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12451', []]\n",

However, since the Cloud is honest but curious, sensitive information belonging to the IoT devices owners might be accessed and used beyond the intended purpose. Therefore, data privacy on Cloud servers should be preserved, which means that they should not reveal any piece of personally identifiable information (PII). Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a new form of public key encryption. ABE is a good candidate to achieve privacy and fine-grained access control for IoT applications running on Cloud servers. However, performing all the related cryptographic operations on such devices is practically infeasible because of their resource constraints. For alleviating all the computation burden on these resource-limited devices, several schemes have been proposed.

Volumetric error vectors (VEs) of machine tools can be estimated using methods such as R-test, laser trackers and the scale and master ball artefact (SAMBA) method. During one measurement, a series of volumetric error vectors can be acquired. Herein, volumetric error vector features extracted using vector similarity measures (VSMs), such as the Module, the Cosine, the Area and the Volume measures, are subsequently processed by fractal analysis for quantitative assessment of the machine tool volumetric error state. Although VEs have recently been processed directly using fractals, this paper documents the first attempt to process VEs, extracted by VSMs, using fractal analysis. The proposed method is validated using VEs measured from the machine tool in its normal state and faulty state with real and pseudo-faults. In addition, simulated faults caused by the change of IS0230-1 error parameters are also applied. The results reveal that the performance of the proposed method in machine tools state representation is related to VSMs. Fractal analysis of VEs features extracted by the Area and Volume measures performs better than fractal analysis of Modu and Cosine measure in VEs condition evaluation.

To allow the multiple access scenario without using excessive bandwidth, each user has N-P predefined private frequencies from the N available frequencies to transmit its reference signal and share with the other users the remaining frequencies to transmit its M spread bits. In this new design, N-P duplicated chaotic reference signals are used to transmit M bits instead of using M different chaotic reference signals as done in DCSK systems. Moreover, given that N-P << M, the MU OFDM-DCSK scheme increases spectral efficiency, uses less energy and allows multiple-access scenario. Therefore, the use of OFDM technique reduces the integration complexity of the system where the parallel low pass filters are no longer needed to recover the transmitted data as in multicarrier DCSK scheme.

Consequently, we investigate the physical layer security over Fox's H-function fading wiretap channels, in the presence of non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers. In particular, for the non-colluding scenario, closed-form expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability (SOP), the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity, and the average secrecy capacity. These expressions are given in terms of either univariate or bivariate Fox's H-function. In order to show the effectiveness of our derivations, three metrics are respectively listed over the following frequently used fading channels, including Rayleigh, Weibull, Nakagami-m, alpha - mu, Fisher-Snedecor (F-S) F, and extended generalized-K. Our tractable results are not only straightforward and general, but also feasible and applicable, especially the SOP, which is usually limited to the lower bound in the literature due to the difficulty of deriving closed-from analytical expressions. For the colluding scenario, a super eavesdropper equipped with maximal ratio combining (MRC) or selection-combining (SC) schemes is characterized. The lower bound of SOP and exact PNZ are thereafter derived with closed-form expressions in terms of the multivariate Fox's H-function. In order to validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte Carlo simulations are subsequently conducted for the aforementioned fading channels. One can observe that for the former non-colluding scenario, we have perfect agreement between the exact analytical and simulation results, and highly accurate approximations between the exact and asymptotic analytical results. On the contrary, the SOP and PNZ of colluding eavesdropper is greatly degraded with the increase of the number of eavesdroppers.

The interlink cross-correlation coefficients of these LSPs are assessed based on two different measurement approaches: 1) synchronous measurements, where the values of the LSPs of the considered links are estimated from the same measurement run; and 2) repeated measurements, where the values of the LSPs of the considered links are estimated from different measurement runs. Repeated measurements are attractive because they are simpler and less expensive.

Based on analysis of wideband synchronous and repeated multilink measurements in a suburban microcell environment at 2.6 GHz, we found that: 1) the mean values of the cross-correlation coefficients are preserved with repeated measurements, and 2) the estimates of the cross-correlation coefficients from repeated measurements are less spread around the mean value than those from synchronous measurements.

In particular, the bit stream is divided at the transmitter into blocks of n + 1 bits, where n mapped bits are used to select one of the predefined reference sequence permutations, while a single modulated bit is spread by the permuted reference signal just mentioned. At the receiver side, the reference signal is recovered first, then all permuted versions of it are correlated with the data-bearing signal. The index of the correlator output with maximum magnitude will estimate the mapped bits, while the output content of the corresponding correlator is compared to a zero threshold to recover the modulated bit.

Over the past two decades, several research works, methods and software have been developed to combine the 3D digital model of BIM (building information modeling) to the construction activities in order to simulate a 4D simulation of the project construction process. The fourth dimension is time. The simulation shows the work sequences with the aim of correcting planning errors, execution conflicts and serving as an aid in optimizing the worksite. The time dimension was added by integrating the Gantt/Precedence diagram into the simulation. Despite its almost exclusive popularity, this method hardly represents the spatial management of the site, the occupancy rate and the circulation of people and materials. For that, the 4D modeling process was quite demanding in terms of time and effort with several rounds back and forth between the BIM model and the schedule. The Chronographic modeling, a space planning method has the ability to alternate between visual representations approaches using a set of graphical parameters. Each approach can help to model adapted schedules for different project types and specialties, shows valuable information in a clear and comprehensible manner and facilitate solving construction site problems visually. The aim of this paper is to present a communication strategy between the 3D-BIM model, the Chronographical modeling and the 4D simulation. The development process consists of four steps. The first step is to define the numerical parameters to adapt the model to the space management. The second step serves to develop a communication strategy and tool. The third step presents the Chronological scheduling process and the last step was the validation of the results through the simulation. The obtained result demonstrates the validity of the proposed solution by integrating the spatial management to the 4D simulation. Future work could integrate supply management and or apply the solution to case studies in order to validate and improve the process.', 'BIM; 4D modeling; Chronographical modeling; Scheduling; Space-planning', 'Review', 'WOS', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103076', ['review match']]\n",

Atomic force microscopy is the ideal platform to gauge interatomic forces between the tip and the sample. For such quantitative measurements, either the oscillation frequency or the oscillation amplitude and the phase of a vibrating cantilever are recorded as a function of the tip-sample separation. These experimental quantities are subsequently converted into the tip-sample interaction force, which can be compared with interatomic force laws to reveal the governing physical phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that the most commonly applied mathematical conversion techniques may suffer a significant deviation from the actual tip-sample interaction forces. To avoid the assessment of unphysical interatomic forces, the use of either very small (i.e., a few picometers) or very large oscillation amplitudes (i.e., a few nanometers) has been proposed. However, the use of marginal oscillation amplitudes gives rise to another problem as it lacks the feasibility due to the adverse signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we show a new mathematical conversion principle that confronts interatomic force measurements while preserving the oscillation amplitude within the experimentally achievable and favorable limits, i.e., tens of picometers. Our theoretical calculations and complementary experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique has three major advantages over existing methodologies: (I) eliminating mathematical instabilities of the reconstruction of tip-sample interaction force, (II) enabling accurate conversion deep into the repulsive regime of tip-sample interaction force, and (III) being robust to the uncertainty of the oscillation amplitude and the measurement noise. Due to these advantages, we anticipate that our methodology will be the nucleus of a reliable evaluation of material properties with a more accurate measurement of tip-sample interaction forces.', '', 'Article', 'WOS', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0052126', ['review match']]\n",

This research study focused, on one hand, at estimating the heating costs for experimental and virtual parts by changing the volume and keeping the same process cycle times. The heating power was determined by simulating the process thermal diagram numerically using finite elements COMSOL software and validated by experimental data. On the other hand, the tooling costs were estimated by DFMA software for experimental and virtual moulds by changing the projected area. Then, the heating energy and tooling costs sizing scaling laws were established under linear equation forms limited to the size of platens areas. These linear equations were inputted in an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the cost of new parts, which have not been made yet. The variation of the total cost with the size and the complexity of the part were investigated. The results showed that the calculated heating energy costs of the three experimental randomly oriented strand parts were different due to different geometries of the heating platens and the moulds.

For such tests, specimen preparation is important, particularly the saturation process. The presence of gas bubbles in the tested specimen leads to smaller hydraulic conductivity values and may affect particle migration. Therefore, measures must be taken to obtain fully saturated specimens. In order to improve saturation, two elements have to be taken into consideration: first, the presence of gas in the permeant water; second, the presence of gas in the pores of the specimen. Several flow tests are described in ASTM standards. These standards involve different conditioning methods for permeant water (e.g., heating, seepage through a sand filter, cavitation under vacuum), and different specimen saturation methods (e.g., saturation with an upward flow under vacuum, following carbon dioxide flushing). In this article, water deaeration and specimen saturation methods were evaluated and compared using a mass-volume method. In the first phase, the importance of using deaerated permeant water was examined by comparing different conditioning methods for permeant water. Saturation using water in equilibrium with atmospheric pressure was compared with saturation with water heated at 40 degrees C, water deaerated using a sand filter, and water deaerated by cavitation under vacuum. In the second phase, the influence of purging the gas contained in the soil specimen before saturation using carbon dioxide or a vacuum was compared. In both cases, the permeant water was deaerated by cavitation under vacuum. These tests showed that combining a purge of the specimen with carbon dioxide with saturation using an upward flow of water deaerated by cavitation under vacuum yielded the highest degree of saturation for granular specimens in a rigid-wall permeameter.

The index for the k-th nearest user is extracted from the ordering, in terms of the distances between transmitters and receivers, whereas that for the k-th best user is based on the combined effects of path-loss and small-scale fading. In particular, the probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions of the composite channel gain for the k-th nearest and best user are characterized, respectively. Benefiting from these results, closed-form representations of the COP, PNZ, and ergodic secrecy capacity are subsequently obtained.

In contrast to most previous works, where the guidelines for BRS are limited to Gaussian noise, in this paper, we propose a novel relay selection protocol for a decode-and-forward cooperative network taking into account the bursty impulsive noise (IN). The proposed protocol chooses the Nth best relay considering both the channel gains and the states of the IN of the source-relay and relay-destination links. For this scheme, to obtain the state of IN, we propose a state detection algorithm using maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. To analyze the performance of the proposed protocol, we first derive closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio assuming all the relays know the state of IN perfectly (genie-condition). Then, these PDFs are used to derive closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) and the outage probability. Finally, we also derive the asymptotic BER and outage expressions to quantify the diversity benefits.

Hence, there is a trade-off between the data volume and the data rates attributed to the users. To avoid the adverse effect of service inaccessibility, the cellular providers should carefully set the size and pricing of their data packages. Toward this end, the providers need a model that, together with proper market information, would allow to set the best prices for volume-based data and estimate the acceptable quantity of subscribers and their average data rate.

Spectrum resources without crosstalk are always preferred for the services to guarantee quality of service, possibly resulting in the spectrum fragmentation. Conversely, if resources with crosstalk are selected for services to reduce fragments, it may lead to serious crosstalk on the services already carried in the adjacent cores.

A problem of jointly designing UAVs' positions, transmit beamforming, as well as UAV-UE association is formulated in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to maximize the sum UEs' achievable rate subject to limited fronthaul capacity constraints. Solving the considered problem is hard owing to its non-convexity and the unavailability of channel state information (CSI) due to the movement of UAVs. To tackle these effects, we propose a novel algorithm comprising of two distinguishing features: (i) exploiting a deep Q-learning approach to tackle the issue of CSI unavailability for determining UAVs' positions, (ii) developing a difference of convex algorithm (DCA) to efficiently solve for the UAV's transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association. The proposed algorithm recursively solves the problem of interest until convergence, where each recursion executes two steps. In the first step, the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm allows UAVs to learn the overall network state and account for the joint movement of all UAVs to adapt their locations. In the second step, given the determined UAVs' positions from the DQL algorithm, the DCA iteratively solves a convex approximate subproblem of the original non-convex MINLP problem with the updated parameters, where the problem's variables are transmit beamforming and UAV-UE association.

First, electrocardiogram signals were pre-processed and segmented and then machine learning and deep learning methods were applied for sleep apnea detection. Among conventional machine learning algorithms, linear and quadratic discriminate analyses, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, Gaussian process, support-vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, extra tree, random forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, multi-layer perceptron, and majority voting were implemented. Among deep algorithms, convolutional networks (Alex-Net, VGG16, VGG19, ZF-Net), recurrent networks (LSTM, bidirectional ISTM, gated recurrent unit), and hybrid convolutional-recurrent networks were implemented. All networks were similarly modified to handle our biosignal processing task. The available data were divided into a training set to adjust the model parameters, a validation set to adjust hyperparameters, avoid overfitting, and improve the generalizability of the models, and a test set to evaluate the generalizability of the models on unseen data. This procedure was then repeated in a fivefold cross-validation scheme so that all the recordings were once located in the test set. It was found that the best detection performance is achieved by hybrid deep models where the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 88.13%, 84.26%, and 92.27%, respectively.

Its main role is to improve ground stability and reduce ore dilution. Its other advantages include the reduction of surface mining waste disposal, which in turn reduces and even eliminates some problems, such as tailing dam failure or acid mine drainage (AMD), associated with mining waste management. To ensure a safe and economical backfill design, the strength of the backfill must be high enough to allow it to remain stable during the exploitation of adjacent stopes, at the very least. This minimum required strength is usually estimated using a solution proposed in the early 1980s. However, this solution includes several limitations, including the following: it assumed a zero friction angle of backfill; it neglected the surcharge on top of the exposed backfill; it assumed an equivalency between the backfill cohesion and the bond cohesion (adherence) along the interfaces between the backfill and side walls; it neglected the shear strength contributed by friction along the interfaces between the backfill and back and side walls, as well as the shear strength contributed by cohesion along the interface between the backfill and back wall; and it assumed a high aspect ratio (height-over-width) stope.

The UDs of a given cluster can receive data from a certain fog access point (F-AP) over the same radio resource blocks (RRBs) simultaneously. To this end, RSMA enabled data transmission is exploited at each UD cluster. To manage intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference of the network, we focus on the resource allocation to maximize the sum-rate and to minimize total transmission power of the F-APs in each transmission slot. Towards this goal, we optimize jointly the F-APs' transmit power allocation for RSMA enabled data transmission, clustering of UDs, and assignment of RRBs among the F-APs. The proposed optimization problem is NP-hard, and as a result, a global optimal solution is computationally intractable even with the centralized implementation. To obtain an efficient solution without having the global network information, the proposed optimization problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, namely, UD clustering and resource allocation among the F-APs. Specifically, the UD clusters are obtained by applying a multi-agent RL technique, and the resource allocation among the F-APs is obtained by applying the fractional programming, Lagrangian duality, and alternating optimization techniques. A distributed user clustering-power allocation-RRB assignment (UC-PA-RA) algorithm is proposed, and its convergence to the near-optimal solution is proved.

As the number of interferers increases, the performance loss gets more severe and RFI excision becomes more difficult. In this regard, this paper introduces the multi-linear algebra framework to the multi-interferer RFI (MI-RFI) excision research by proposing a multi-linear subspace estimation and projection (MLSEP) algorithm for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems suffering from MI-RFI. Having employed smoothed observation windows, a smoothed MLSEP (s-MLSEP) algorithm, which enhances MLSEP, is also proposed. MLSEP and s-MLSEP require the knowledge of the number of interferers and their respective channel order. Accordingly, a novel smoothed matrix-based joint number of interferers and channel order enumerator is proposed. Performance analyses corroborate that both MLSEP and s-MLSEP can excise all interferers when the perturbations get infinitesimally small. For such perturbations, the analyses also attest that s-MLSEP exhibit a faster convergence to a zero excision error than MLSEP which, in turn converges faster than a subspace projection algorithm. Despite its slight complexity, simulations and performance assessment on real-world data demonstrate that MLSEP outperforms projection-based RFI excision algorithms.

However, the existing data stream management systems are not efficient in analyzing the network log big data for real-time anomaly detection. Further, the existing anomaly detection approaches are not proficient because they cannot be applied to networks, are computationally complex, and suffer from high false positives. Thus, in this paper a hybrid data processing model for network anomaly detection is proposed that leverages grey wolf optimization (GWO) and convolutional neural network (CNN). To enhance the capabilities of the proposed model, GWO and CNN learning approaches were enhanced with: 1) improved exploration, exploitation, and initial population generation abilities and 2) revamped dropout functionality, respectively. These extended variants are referred to as Improved-GWO (ImGWO) and Improved-CNN (ImCNN). The proposed model works in two phases for efficient network anomaly detection. In the first phase, ImGWO is used for feature selection in order to obtain an optimal trade-off between two objectives, i.e., reduced error rate and feature-set minimization. In the second phase, ImCNN is used for network anomaly classification. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated on benchmark (DARPA'98 and KDD'99) and synthetic datasets. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed cloud-based anomaly detection model is superior in comparison to the other state-of-the-art models (used for network anomaly detection), in terms of accuracy, detection rate, false positive rate, and F-score.

This method is said to reduce installation costs and facilitate installation, especially for nested piezometers. The success of a fully grouted installation depends upon the ratio of grout and surrounding soil hydraulic conductivity and upon the grout physical stability. This article presents new results from field tests and numerical simulations regarding the performance of fully grouted piezometers under transient flow conditions. The field observations show that using low-permeability grout for piezometer installation provides precise pore water pressure (PWP) measurements. This confirms previous findings on the fully grouted installation technique. Field observations for a very high-permeability grout that could be more than 1,100 times more permeable than the soil result in PWPs that totally differ from the PWP obtained with a low-permeability grout. Using three scenarios involving transient flow, the numerical results show that hydraulic conductivity ratios between 0.001 and 10 provide an accurate pore pressure response without a significant time lag for soils with a very low permeability (K <= 2 x 10(-9) m/s). For most practical applications, a hydraulic conductivity ratio of 100 is the upper limit to obtain acceptable pore pressure measurements for these soils. A large hydraulic conductivity ratio may cause a hydraulic short circuit between the fully grouted piezometer and the upper aquifer. For a borehole diameter of 100 mm, the numerical results demonstrate that grout stiffness has no significant impact on the performance of fully grouted piezometers. However, grout stiffness is important for the long-term performance of the fully grouted piezometer. This article also introduces preliminary results regarding a testing program on grout properties. These results confirm pervious findings by others that the preparation of low-permeability grout is not trivial and that grout initial viscosity controls its physical stability and hydraulic conductivity.', 'pore pressure; cement-bentonite grout; fully grouted piezometer; field experiment; numerical modeling; low-permeability soil', 'Review', 'WOS', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/GTJ20170290', ['review match']]\n",

Chatter detection in this situation is a crucial step for improving surface quality and reducing both noise and rapid wear of the cutting tool. This paper proposes a new methodology for the chatter detection in computer numerical control milling machines. This methodology is based on vibratory signal analysis and artificial intelligence. The methodology consists of five major steps: (1) data acquisition, (2) signal processing, (3) features generation, (4) features selection and (5) classification. As chatter components occur around system resonance frequencies, a multiband resonance filtering method is proposed at the processing step. The process is then followed by envelope analysis. This allows the signal-to-noise ratio to be increased and the sensitivity of generated features to be increased. Extracted features are then ranked based on their entropy in which only best features are selected and presented to the system for classification. At the classification step, the selected features are classified into two classes: stable and unstable utilizing neural networks. Two neural network approaches, radial basis function and multi-layer perceptrons, are tested. The developed approach is applied for chatter detection in a Huron K2X10 milling machine. This approach is tested on a milling machine at different depths of cut and various rotational speeds.

At a GSE, players that are unsatisfied are unable to unilaterally deviate to be satisfied. The concept of GSE generalizes the SE in the sense that it allows mixed-strategy equilibria in which there exist players who are unable to satisfy their individual constraints. The pure-strategy GSE problem is closely related to the constraint satisfaction problem and finding a pure-strategy GSE is proven to be NP-hard.

Moreover, because the electricity's environmental impacts, cost and demand all vary over time, the potential for RE may also fluctuate. Accounting for these temporal aspects could therefore provide more insights into how and why potential RE may occur in smart homes, especially with regard to households' behaviours. In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate standard and smart home electricity consumption. Life cycle assessment and environmentally extended input-output tables are used to calculate the households' electricity consumption and RE GHG emissions during the simulations. Results show that, while indirect RE in smart homes is low (about 5% in the simulations), the choice of metric used for smart electricity management is key to maximize the GHG emissions reductions of smart homes. When smart homes perform load shifting based on an economic rather than environmental signal, RE increases by almost five-fold.

Then, a hybrid interpolation scheme based on curves and surfaces is proposed, which differs from the traditional surface interpolation methods. Specifically, smooth regions are interpolated by the non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) surface geometric iteration. To retain textures, control points are increased, and the progressive-iterative approximation of the NURBS surface is employed to interpolate the texture regions. By considering edges in an image as curve segments that are connected by pixels with dramatic changes, we use NURBS curve progressive-iterative approximation to interpolate the edges, which sharpens the edges and can maintain the image edge structure without jaggy and block artifacts.

Organisation and managing available parking spaces have raised a lot of awareness. Traditional centralized parking approaches are with an insidious single point of failure and unsuitable for large organization because the manager is over burdened with authority and responsibility. The malicious service provider enables to (i) track the precise mobility patterns of citizens. (ii) collect the data to infer privacy-sensitive information, e.g., where the parking requester (i.e., driver) socialize, work, and live; (iii) analyze trajectories to monitor the location of the driver for entertainment (e.g., discovering one-night stands). To design a decentralized smart and practical parking platform without compromising the privacy of the entities is an urgent issue for the smart city. Blockchain (or distributed public ledger technology) is a near-ideal decentralized and distributed solution for centralized parking-space-recommendation systems. However, most of the existing parking recommendation solutions on top of blockchain ignore to protect the privacy of drivers during parking spot detection and matching phases while cannot maintain the property of anonymity of the drivers. In this paper, an efficient and privacy-preserving parking-space recommendation service platform, named as PriParkRec, along with the proof-of-concept solution to protect the requester's privacy in PriParkRec while maintaining most of the benefits of current parking-space sharing service, i.e., accountability, (anonymous) authentication, (anonymous) payment, and reputation ratings. Indeed, PriParkRec service relies on well-known privacy-enhancing cryptographic building blocks (e.g., oblivious PRF, private set intersection, anonymous credentials, anonymous payment, and smart-contract, etc), these building blocks are carefully integrated together to achieve privacy and security goals to revolutionize the existing car-parking service system coming with the private blockchain and industrial internet of things (IIoTs) technologies.\", 'Privacy-enhancing cryptographic techniques; recommendation service; parking space sharing; blockchain technology', 'Article', 'WOS', 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3074820', []]\n"
